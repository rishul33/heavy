Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

The third child in a family of three sons and three daughters, Bolsonaro attended the Preparatory School of the Brazilian Army and graduated from the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in 1977. He then served in the army for some 17 years, including a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="stint" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/stint" data-type="EB">stint</a> as a paratrooper, and rose to the rank of captain. Bolsonaro gained notoriety in 1986 when he wrote an article for the popular magazine <em>Veja</em> in which he was critical of the military’s pay system. That public stance earned Bolsonaro condemnation from his superiors but was celebrated by his fellow officers and military families.</p><!--[P2]--><span class="marker p2"></span><!--[AM2]--><span class="marker AM2 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD2]--><span class="marker MOD2 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">After leaving the army in 1988, Bolsonaro was elected to a seat on the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Rio-de-Janeiro-Brazil" class="md-crosslink">Rio de Janeiro</a> city council in 1989. Two years later he won a seat representing Rio de Janeiro in Brazil’s federal Chamber of Deputies that he would hold for seven consecutive terms. From his first term, Bolsanaro repeatedly praised the era of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/military-rule" class="md-crosslink autoxref">military rule</a> and called for its return. He also began establishing a reputation for outspoken <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="advocacy" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/advocacy" data-type="MW">advocacy</a> of deeply <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/conservatism" class="md-crosslink">conservative</a> positions on social issues and was branded by critics as a misogynist, homophobe, and racist. Among the many controversial remarks that he made over the years was his statement that he “would be incapable of loving a homosexual son” and that he would prefer his son to die in an accident rather than “show up with a mustachioed man.” When a female member of the Chamber of Deputies called him a rapist, Bolsonaro responded by saying, “I wouldn’t rape you because you don’t deserve it.” Later, having stated that he was not a rapist, he added that if he were, he would not rape the congresswoman in question because she was “not his type.” Commenting on the descendants of the fugitive African slaves who organized the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/quilombo" class="md-crosslink"><em>quilombo</em></a> <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="communities" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities" data-type="MW">communities</a>, Bolsonaro said, “They do nothing! They are not even good for procreation.”</p><!--[P3]--><span class="marker p3"></span><!--[AM3]--><span class="marker AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="marker MOD3 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Inflammatory comments such as those contributed to the perception of Bolsonaro as an extremist and consigned to the political margins. Thus, he was able to author little successful legislation during his long <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="tenure" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenure" data-type="MW">tenure</a> in the Chamber of Deputies. Nonetheless, he served as the head of the Committee on Foreign Relations and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Narodna-Odbrana" class="md-crosslink autoxref">National Defense</a>. He also was a member of the Commission on Human and Minority Rights and an alternate member of the Committee on Public Security and Combating Organized Crime.</p><!--[P4]--><span class="marker p4"></span><!--[AM4]--><span class="marker AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="marker MOD4 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Having entered elective office as a member of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Italian-Popular-Party" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Christian Democratic Party</a>, in 1993 Bolsonaro shifted <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="allegiance" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance" data-type="MW">allegiance</a> to the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="incipient" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incipient" data-type="MW">incipient</a> Progressive Party, which joined forces with the Reform Progressive Party in 1995 to become the Brazilian Progressive Party. He changed party affiliation again in 2003, joining the Brazilian Labour Party, and in 2005, after a brief stint as a member of the Liberal Front, he returned to the fold of the Brazilian Progressive Party, which had readopted the name Progressive Party two years earlier. In 2016 he joined the Social Christian Party.</p><!--[P5]--><span class="marker p5"></span><!--[AM5]--><span class="marker AM5 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD5]--><span class="marker MOD5 mod-inline"></span> </section> <!--[H3]--><span class="marker h3"></span><section id="ref347597" data-level="1"> <h2 class="h1">The 2018 presidential election</h2> <p class="topic-paragraph">Bolsonaro’s fortunes changed when Brazil’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-culture" class="md-crosslink autoxref">political culture</a> spiraled downward in the second decade of the 21st century and the country’s economy went along for the ride. At the beginning of the second presidential term of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dilma-Rousseff" class="md-crosslink">Dilma Rousseff</a> of the Workers’ Party, the country sunk deeper into a recession that had begun in 2014 and became mired in what some observers <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="characterized" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/characterized" data-type="EB">characterized</a> as Brazil’s worst economic crisis since the turn of the 20th century. In the meantime, the biggest political scandal in Brazilian history—the Petrobras scandal—was unfolding, swelling to seemingly engulf the majority of Brazil’s mainstream politicians in allegations of corruption. Accused of financial accounting improprieties, Rousseff was impeached and removed from office. Her successor, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Temer" class="md-crosslink">Michel Temer</a>, was likewise the target of accusations of wrongdoing and saw his public approval rating shrink to single digits. At the same time, violence and crime in Brazil spiked.</p><!--[P6]--><span class="marker p6"></span><!--[AM6]--><span class="marker AM6 am-inline"></span><DIV class="marketing-INLINE_SUBSCRIPTION marketing-content" data-marketing-id="INLINE_SUBSCRIPTION"><div class="inline-subscription mb-30 mx-sm-20 font-16 text-center">

While Lula sought to be allowed to run for president in spite of his conviction, Bolsonaro, the candidate of the theretofore insignificant Social Liberal Party, mounted a populist campaign that sought to take advantage of Brazilians’ widespread disenchantment with the political establishment and rampant corruption. Using his outsider status to his advantage, Bolsonaro cast himself as an antiestablishment insurgent candidate with little concern for political correctness—in the vein of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Trump" class="md-crosslink">Donald Trump</a>, who had successfully <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="leveraged" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/leveraged" data-type="EB">leveraged</a> that stance to win the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-presidential-election-of-2016" class="md-crosslink">2016 U.S. presidential election</a>; indeed, Bolsonaro was soon labeled the “Trump of the Tropics.” Bolsonaro also won the support of the country’s considerable Evangelical Christian population with his steadfast opposition to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/abortion-pregnancy" class="md-crosslink autoxref">abortion</a>, and his championing of law-and-order policies appealed to Brazilians concerned with crime and violence.</p><!--[P7]--><span class="marker p7"></span><!--[AM7]--><span class="marker AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="marker MOD7 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">On September 6, while campaigning in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Juiz-de-Fora" class="md-crosslink">Juiz de Fora</a>, Bolsonaro was stabbed by a would-be assassin. His wounds required lifesaving surgery, after which he was forced to campaign from a hospital bed and then at home. However, Bolsonaro had already established a strong presence on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-media" class="md-crosslink autoxref">social media</a>, attracting more than 5.2 million <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Facebook" class="md-crosslink">Facebook</a> followers and as many as one million viewers to some of his video posts.</p><!--[P8]--><span class="marker p8"></span><!--[AM8]--><span class="marker AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="marker MOD8 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">In early August the national <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="convention" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/convention" data-type="EB">convention</a> of the Workers’ Party chose Lula as its candidate, but, after the Superior Electoral Court ruled on August 31 that he was “ineligible” to run for the presidency, Lula withdrew his candidacy on September 11 and threw his support to his running mate, <span id="ref1261311"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fernando-Haddad" class="md-crosslink">Fernando Haddad</a>, the former mayor of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sao-Paulo-Brazil" class="md-crosslink autoxref">São Paulo</a>. As result of Lula’s departure from the race, Bolsonaro became the prohibitive favourite in the contest. In the first round of voting on October 7, he far outpaced the rest of the 13-candidate field, capturing some 46 percent of the vote but falling short of the 50 percent necessary to prevent a runoff. Thus, the stage was set for a head-to-head battle on October 28 with Haddad, who had finished second in the first round with about 29 percent of the vote. Bolsonaro then swept to a commanding victory in the runoff, taking more than 55 percent of the vote, to become Brazil’s president-elect.</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span> </section> <!--[H4]--><span class="marker h4"></span><section id="ref347598" data-level="1"> <h2 class="h1">Bolsonaro’s presidency</h2> <p class="topic-paragraph">One of the issues on which Bolsonaro had run for the presidency was reform of Brazil’s generous national pension scheme, which accounted for some 40 percent of total federal spending. In October 2019, largely in response to the efforts of the minister of economics, Paulo Guedes, <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="Congress" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Congress" data-type="EB">Congress</a> approved a dramatic overhaul of the system, which hinged on raising the minimum retirement age for men and women from ages 56 and 53 to ages 65 and 62, respectively. This restructuring, which had eluded Bolsonaro’s predecessors as president, was a big policy win for him.</p><!--[P10]--><span class="marker p10"></span><!--[AM10]--><span class="marker AM10 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD10]--><span class="marker MOD10 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Bolsonaro’s all-but-official championing of deforestation in the Amazon region proved to be much less broadly popular, though his reduction of the punitive powers of the country’s environmental agencies—which protected the Amazon rainforest and the interests of <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="indigenous" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenous" data-type="MW">indigenous</a> people who lived there—was warmly greeted by the business sectors that profited from the region’s exploitation. Bolsonaro’s government turned a blind eye to illegal logging concerns that clear-cut protected land and then burned the remaining trees to make way for cattle ranching and mining. However, in July and August 2019, when forest fires in the region were blazing at levels that had not been reached for some 10 years, there was an uproar both within Brazil and from an international <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="community" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community" data-type="MW">community</a> that was concerned about the impact the damaging of the rainforest would have on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-change" class="md-crosslink autoxref">climate change</a>. Bolsonaro responded by instituting a 60-day ban on fires set to clear land. He also <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="deployed" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deployed" data-type="MW">deployed</a> 44,000 military personnel to combat the fires and accepted the help of four firefighting planes sent by the Chilean government. By October the threat had abated, but some 2,930 square miles (7,600 square km) of rainforest had been deforested in the first nine months of the year. That Bolsonaro had shown little compassion for the indigenous people displaced by the deforestation and fires came as no great surprise, given his habitual <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="disdain" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disdain" data-type="MW">disdain</a> for them, a feeling that matched his frequently expressed intolerance of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgendered-and-queer-community" class="md-crosslink autoxref">LGBTQ community</a>, which satisfied the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="prejudices" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prejudices" data-type="MW">prejudices</a> of some of his supporters among <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="conservative" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservative" data-type="MW">conservative</a> factions of Roman Catholics and Evangelicals.</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Many observers accused Bolsonaro of egregiously misleading the country when it came to Brazil’s unsteady and ultimately tragically inadequate response to the spread of the potentially deadly <span id="ref1301558"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/COVID-19" class="md-crosslink">COVID-19</a>, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, cases of which had originally been reported in China in December 2019. In March 2020, after the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Health-Organization" class="md-crosslink autoxref">World Health Organization</a> declared the outbreak a global pandemic, state and local governments in Brazil began instituting aggressive social-distancing and lockdown measures to combat the disease. However, despite being taken in advance of the pandemic’s onslaught on Brazil, these efforts were <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="undermined" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/undermined" data-type="EB">undermined</a> by the federal government’s lacklustre response, which took its cues from Bolsonaro. He repeatedly downplayed the disease’s severity, mocked the mask-wearing that provided the first line of defense against the spread of the virus, and blocked attempts to lock down elements of the economy to try to contain the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-health" class="md-crosslink autoxref">public health</a> crisis. As a result, a Brazilian health care system that was generally well positioned to combat the pandemic ultimately faltered badly.</p><!--[P12]--><span class="marker p12"></span><!--[AM12]--><span class="marker AM12 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD12]--><span class="marker MOD12 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">When he contracted the disease himself in July, during the first wave of the pandemic in Brazil, Bolsonaro continued to interact with others in public without wearing a mask or maintaining social distance. In addition, he claimed that he had benefited from taking <span id="ref1301559"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hydroxychloroquine" class="md-crosslink">hydroxychloroquine</a>, a drug that not only proved to be ineffective against the virus but also had the potential to produce dangerous side effects. Though Brazil’s hospitals and health care workers were challenged, they weathered that first wave of the pandemic relatively well, and by August the number of virus cases and virus-related deaths had dropped dramatically. By November, however, a second wave of the virus had begun descending with a fury after many Brazilians relaxed their <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="adherence" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adherence" data-type="MW">adherence</a> to prevention <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="protocols" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protocols" data-type="MW">protocols</a>. The spiking spread of the disease was <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="exacerbated" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exacerbated" data-type="MW">exacerbated</a> by the slow rollout of the country’s vaccination program, which was not aided by the nay-saying of Bolsonaro, who speciously claimed that the vaccinations posed health hazards.</p><!--[P13]--><span class="marker p13"></span><!--[AM13]--><span class="marker AM13 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD13]--><span class="marker MOD13 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">As the disease proliferated in Brazil, it mutated into a new, more easily transmissible strain, P.1, which spread throughout the country after originating in Manaus late in 2020. In the process, Brazil became the epicentre of a raging outbreak that began extending throughout <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Latin-America" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Latin America</a>. By mid-May 2021, more than 15,000,000 people in Brazil had contracted the coronavirus and more than 428,000 individuals had died from COVID-19-related causes. Even as the situation became increasingly grim, Bolsonaro persisted in downplaying the crisis. However, as his popularity suffered, he began to walk back some of his <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="criticism" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticism" data-type="MW">criticism</a> of the prevention measures, especially after a Supreme Court judge dismissed the corruption charges against Lula in March 2021, paving the way for the popular former president to challenge Bolsonaro for the presidency in 2022.</p><!--[P14]--><span class="marker p14"></span><!--[AM14]--><span class="marker AM14 am-inline"></span><div class="one-good-fact-module">
</div><!--[MOD14]--><span class="marker MOD14 mod-inline"></span>  <p class="topic-paragraph">Months before the election scheduled for October 2022, Bolsonaro began attempting to sow doubt in Brazil’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/electronic-voting" class="md-crosslink autoxref">electronic voting</a> system, claiming without evidence that it was <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="vulnerable" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable" data-type="MW">vulnerable</a> to fraud and indicating that he might not recognize the results of the election.
