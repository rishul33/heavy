But that’s not how most wealth is created. Instead, wealth creation is typically the get-rich-slowly kind, powered by compounding.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Key Points</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><ul><li>Compounding means getting returns on your previous returns as well as your initial investment.</li><li>Compounded interest can power your returns over time, especially if you have patience.</li><li>The earlier your money starts compounding, the more pronounced the effect will be.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">Interest on your interest. Returns on your investment returns. No wonder it’s been called the eighth wonder of the world.</p> <h2 id="toc-351786">Real-World Compounding Example</h2>  <p data-seq="4">How does compounding work? Suppose you start with $1,000 in your retirement account. You might invest it in something simple, such as a fund that tracks the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index. You can probably find one of those in your <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/401k-plan">401(k) plan</a>, and they’re great for beginning investors because of their low cost. </p> <p data-seq="5">Suppose the returns over three years were 5%, 20%, and 8%, respectively. If each year, those returns were based off the initial $1,000 (i.e., not compounded), the returns would be:</p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li><strong>Year one:</strong> $1,000 x 0.05 = $50</li><li><strong>Year two:</strong> $1,000 x 0.20 = $200</li><li><strong>Year three:</strong> $1,000 x 0.08 = $80</li></ul> <p data-seq="6">The three-year total, not compounded, would be the initial $1,000, plus $50, $200, and $80, which equals <strong>$1,330.</strong> Now let’s watch the growth of that $1,000 with the magic of compounding.</p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li><strong>Year one:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 grows 5%. That’s below its long-term average, but decent. Your $1,000 grows 5%, gaining $50 to reach $1,050.</li><li><strong>Year two:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 has a great year, rising 20%. Your $1,050 grows 20%, rising $210 to reach $1,260.</li><li><strong>Year three:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 has a typical year, rising 8%. Your $1,260 adds 8%, to<strong> $1,360.80.</strong></li></ul> <p data-seq="7">Notice something? The first year was simple. Your initial $1,000 gained 5% along with the market, or $50.  But in year two, your 20% gains weren’t based on the original $1,000 you invested. Instead, they grew from $1,050, reflecting your initial investment plus the $50 you gained in year one. In year three, the compounding had an even more pronounced effect. </p> <p data-seq="8">And that extra bump you get from compounding builds on itself. Slowly at first, but as the years go by, the effect of compounding will continue to accelerate.</p></div><div class="Calculator_Calculator__Cvttx gigacalculator float-sm-right" data-tool="/calculators/compound-interest-calculator.php" data-testid="Calculator"><div class="gigacalctitle text-capitalize">compound interest calculator</div><div class="gigacalcfooter"><a class="text-capitalize" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/compound-interest-calculator.php">compound interest calculator</a> <!-- -->by<!-- --> <a class="gigacalclink" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/">GIGAcalculator.com</a></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="10">Granted, this is an oversimplification. And of course, stock market returns can vary greatly. In some years, stocks even lose money. But, according to data from S&amp;P Global, the long-term annual return for U.S. stocks has been about 9.2%.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351787">Bonds and Compound Interest</h2>  <p data-seq="11">Compounding doesn’t apply exclusively to stocks. Suppose you buy a bond that pays a fixed 4% annual interest (or a 4% “coupon,” in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/bond-market-basics">bond lingo</a>). You invest $1,000 and earn $40 the first year. Assuming you can reinvest the extra $40 at 4%, the next year you’ll see a gain of $41.60, because it’s based on $1,040. That’s the power of compound interest.</p> <p data-seq="12">Enjoying the fruits of compounding takes patience. But if you can keep your hands off your retirement fund—and keep adding to it—compounding can be surprisingly powerful. </p>  <h2 id="toc-351788">Start Early for the Best Chance of Success</h2>  <p data-seq="13">Compounding is especially effective if you start early and add fresh funds each month. If you’re investing with a 401(k), some of this extra cash can come from your company’s matching contributions (if it provides them). Just remember, an early start can make a huge difference once you reach retirement age, because compounded returns have had more time to build on themselves. The longer you stay invested, the larger compounded returns can become.</p> <p data-seq="14">Let’s follow two imaginary investors, Amelia and Ben. Amelia begins with $1,000 at age 25, and she invests $200 a month for 40 years until she retires at age 65. Her annual return averages out to 10% per year.</p> <p data-seq="15">Ben waits longer to start investing. He has a lot of bills (college debt is rough) and it takes him a while to find a steady job right after college. Ben also starts with an initial investment of $1,000, but he begins at age 35, not 25. He also enjoys 10% annual returns, but has 10 fewer years to enjoy the benefits of compounding before he retires, also at age 65.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Caution: Returns Are Neither Straight-Line nor Guaranteed </h2><div class="Investing font-14"><p data-seq="16">The market won’t grow 10% every year. It’s a lot more volatile than that. In 2008, the S&amp;P 500 fell nearly 40%. In other years, it’s gained almost 30%. And once in a while, it’s flat. But remember that long-term historical average of 9.2%. </p> <p data-seq="17">Some investments, such as bonds, tend to be less volatile over time, but also offer lower annual returns. Such is the relationship between risk and return.  </p></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="18">How did things turn out for our two hypothetical investors?</p> <ul><li><strong>Amelia:</strong> After 40 years of compounded returns, Amelia can retire at age 65 with a cool $1.1 million in her portfolio. Yes, Amelia became a millionaire, thanks in part to compounding.</li><li><strong>Ben:</strong> After 30 years of compounded returns, Ben will have $412,000 when he turns 65. That late start made a $700,000 difference. </li></ul> <p data-seq="19">Want to check the math? Punch the numbers into the calculator above. Compounding works.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351789">The Bottom Line</h2>  <p data-seq="20">Harnessing the power of compounded returns—and getting an early start—is a solid strategy to steer toward your long-term financial goals.
