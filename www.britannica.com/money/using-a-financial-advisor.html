Maybe you don’t want to devote so much time and attention to your portfolio. Or perhaps you have a particularly challenging financial picture, with competing goals and complicated assets.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Key Points</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><ul><li>A financial advisor can help investors who lack the time and energy to build and maintain a portfolio on their own.</li><li>It’s important to understand how much a financial advisor’s services cost and whether they’re a fiduciary before hiring them.</li><li>If you have a basic portfolio, a robo-advisor might be a better option than an expensive financial advisor.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">But before deciding, you need to understand what role a financial advisor plays, whether you should seek one who’s a “fiduciary,” and how much financial advisors charge.</p> <h2 id="toc-351843">What Are Financial Advisors and What Do They Do?</h2>  <p data-seq="4">A financial advisor is anyone you pay to recommend investments, assist you with financial planning, or buy and sell securities on your behalf. </p> <p data-seq="5">But there are several specific types of financial professionals, and each one is different. Some handle your stock portfolio and advise you on the suitability of trades. Others work with you on the larger financial picture to create a financial plan that involves your retirement accounts, real estate, and children’s education accounts. Still others go a step further and create an estate plan for your children and future generations.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351844">How Much Do Financial Advisors Charge, and How Do They Bill?</h2>  <p data-seq="6">Each financial advisor has their own fee schedule. There are three main structures for paying:</p> <ul><li><strong>Asset-based fees.</strong> You pay the advisor a percentage (for example, 1%) of the assets they manage for you.</li><li><strong>Sales charges.</strong> You pay a commission on every trade of a stock, bond, or mutual fund the advisor makes on your behalf. Because you’re paying for advice, the charges for these trades are usually much higher than they would be at an online brokerage.</li><li><strong>Flat fee.</strong> To cater to savvier, cost-conscious investors, some financial advisors now charge an hourly rate for their advice, much like a lawyer. </li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-351845">What’s a Financial Advisor vs. a Fiduciary?</h2>  <p data-seq="7">Some financial professionals—including those who register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or a state securities authority to be Registered Investment Advisors—operate under a strict “fiduciary” standard. A fiduciary has a legal duty to put the best interests of their clients above their own. </p> <p data-seq="8">That differs from a “suitability standard,” which is the standard that, historically, many financial advisors have operated under. The suitability standard requires that an advisor make recommendations that are suitable to a client’s personal situation, but doesn’t legally require that they adhere to a fiduciary standard.</p> <p data-seq="9">But a new regulation that came into force in 2020—Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”)—aims to narrow the distinction between suitability and fiduciary standards by requiring broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest when recommending products. Reg BI also requires your broker to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, as well as information about fees, codes of conduct, and any important information about its disciplinary history.</p> <p data-seq="10">The ramifications and legal interpretations of Reg BI are still unfolding. Until there’s full clarity, it’s important to ensure your broker is complying with Reg BI.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351846">Is It Worth Hiring a Financial Advisor?</h2>  <p data-seq="11">If you have substantial investments, an advisor can help oversee those assets to manage risks, maximize returns, and minimize taxes. Those services may be worth the cost, especially if you don’t have the time or expertise to do it yourself.</p> <p data-seq="12">If your assets are less substantial, there are still options available. For starters, you may want to consider a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-robo-advisor">robo-advisor</a>, which creates a customized investing plan based on your responses to a series of questions about your financial goals.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351847">Financial Advisors vs. Self-Directed Investing</h2>  <p data-seq="13">Is it OK to go it on your own without an advisor? Absolutely. There are plenty of information sources, trading platforms, and investment products available to you. Investing on your own is also a great way to limit the dent that fees take out of your returns over time.</p> <p data-seq="14">But there are other factors involved. Do you understand investing basics enough to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/portfolio-diversification-benefits">diversify your portfolio</a>, rebalance regularly in a tax-efficient way, and watch out for risks? If not, you may want to consider enlisting some help. </p> <p data-seq="15">Emotions are another big factor. Can you stick with your plan when there’s a dramatic market swing and you feel like you’re missing out? How about if you suddenly lose a lot of hard-earned money? A good financial advisor can talk you down from the ledge when, for instance, you might feel like selling most of your portfolio during a market downturn.

Some handle your stock portfolio and advise you on the suitability of trades. Others work with you on the larger financial picture to create a financial plan that involves your retirement accounts, real estate, and children’s education accounts. Still others go a step further and create an estate plan for your children and future generations.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351844\"\u003eHow Much Do Financial Advisors Charge, and How Do They Bill?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"6\"\u003eEach financial advisor has their own fee schedule.

A fiduciary has a legal duty to put the best interests of their clients above their own. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"8\"\u003eThat differs from a “suitability standard,” which is the standard that, historically, many financial advisors have operated under. The suitability standard requires that an advisor make recommendations that are suitable to a client’s personal situation, but doesn’t legally require that they adhere to a fiduciary standard.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"9\"\u003eBut a new regulation that came into force in 2020—Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”)—aims to narrow the distinction between suitability and fiduciary standards by requiring broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest when recommending products. Reg BI also requires your broker to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, as well as information about fees, codes of conduct, and any important information about its disciplinary history.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"10\"\u003eThe ramifications and legal interpretations of Reg BI are still unfolding. Until there’s full clarity, it’s important to ensure your broker is complying with Reg BI.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351846\"\u003eIs It Worth Hiring a Financial Advisor?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"11\"\u003eIf you have substantial investments, an advisor can help oversee those assets to manage risks, maximize returns, and minimize taxes. Those services may be worth the cost, especially if you don’t have the time or expertise to do it yourself.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"12\"\u003eIf your assets are less substantial, there are still options available. For starters, you may want to consider a \u003ca href=\"/money/what-is-a-robo-advisor\"\u003erobo-advisor\u003c/a\u003e, which creates a customized investing plan based on your responses to a series of questions about your financial goals.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351847\"\u003eFinancial Advisors vs. Self-Directed Investing\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"13\"\u003eIs it OK to go it on your own without an advisor? Absolutely. There are plenty of information sources, trading platforms, and investment products available to you. Investing on your own is also a great way to limit the dent that fees take out of your returns over time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"14\"\u003eBut there are other factors involved. Do you understand investing basics enough to \u003ca href=\"/money/portfolio-diversification-benefits\"\u003ediversify your portfolio\u003c/a\u003e, rebalance regularly in a tax-efficient way, and watch out for risks? If not, you may want to consider enlisting some help. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"15\"\u003eEmotions are another big factor. Can you stick with your plan when there’s a dramatic market swing and you feel like you’re missing out? How about if you suddenly lose a lot of hard-earned money? A good financial advisor can talk you down from the ledge when, for instance, you might feel like selling most of your portfolio during a market downturn. They can also keep you from being too aggressive when the market is soaring.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351848\"\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"16\"\u003eYou might consider hiring a financial advisor depending on how much you have to invest, how complicated your finances are, and your own expertise and discipline when it comes to investing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"17\"\u003eIf you do choose to hire an advisor, be sure you understand exactly what services they offer, how they charge for those services, what standards they operate under, and what value they’ll provide in terms of your time, energy, and long-term financial health.
