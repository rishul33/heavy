Are company profits steady? Are revenues growing? Are there any warning signs? Any potential product changes? A possible C-suite overhaul?</p> <p data-seq="4">Earnings can also provide a more granular view into a company, such as regional sales, sales of a specific product, or what segment was responsible for most of the revenues.</p> <p data-seq="5">All this information is contained in the 10-Q or 10-K report that publicly traded companies are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During the quarterly earnings call, company executives summarize and discuss the information that’s contained in the 10-Q and 10-K, often followed by a Q&amp;A session with analysts. This gives the public an overall view of how the company performed over the previous quarter and provides guidance about sales, operating costs, and other income-related items. </p>  <h2 id="toc-352081">When Is Earnings Season?</h2>  <p data-seq="6">Earnings season typically occurs after the end of a quarter. Most companies report their quarterly earnings as follows:</p> <ul><li><strong>Q1:</strong> Mid-April to end of May</li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> Mid-July to end of August</li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> Mid-October to end of November</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> Mid-January to end of February</li></ul> <p data-seq="7">How do you know when a company you’ve invested in—or are considering investing in—announces earnings? You can find this information from:</p> <ul><li><strong>Company website.</strong> You’ll find the earnings conference call schedule under the investor relations section. Note that the earnings date could change, so check this page regularly for any updates.</li><li><strong>Your broker.</strong> When you look up a stock symbol, you’ll usually find earnings information on the quote page.</li><li><strong>Earnings calendar.</strong> These are published on financial websites or publications.  </li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-352082">What to Look for in an Earnings Report</h2>  <p data-seq="8">Listening to an earnings call or combing through a company’s financial statements isn’t exactly a fun way to spend a few hours. The good news is you don’t have to. But if you own a company’s stock, you should at least be aware of a few key points: </p> <ul><li><strong>Consensus and whisper numbers.</strong> Analysts covering a company—investment banks and other financial researchers—will release estimates for earnings and revenue ahead of each earnings release. These estimates are compiled by financial media outlets, which average them out into what’s known as consensus. Other financial players who have done their own research have expectations that may differ greatly from the reported consensus. Wall Street calls those unofficial estimates “whisper numbers.”  </li><li><strong>Historical data.</strong> Prior to the earnings report, it may help to look at past reports. How did the company do in the previous quarter, and what guidance did it provide? Looking at historical earnings can shed some light, but the past isn’t necessarily a reflection of the future, so use this only as a reference.</li><li><strong>Earnings per share and revenues.</strong> What are analysts’ estimates for earnings per share and revenues? Compare these estimates to the same quarter in the previous year. Are the estimates for the upcoming earnings higher or lower? You can find this information on most stock market news sites.</li><li><strong>Company earnings guidance.</strong> Companies sometimes provide guidance for the next quarter or year in their earnings report. This guidance gives an idea of a company’s future profitability, which could help investors determine if they should invest in the stock.</li></ul> <p data-seq="9">Once earnings are reported, you can compare the results with analyst estimates. Did earnings meet expectations or did they fall short? How did the market react to the earnings release? Look for red flags—bloated inventory, slower demand, supply chain issues. If you missed listening to the earnings call, you can find a transcript on the company’s website or a press release that summarizes the main points.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352083">Why Should Investors Follow Earnings?</h2>  <p data-seq="10">Just as you take your car in for a regular maintenance check, you should check on your stocks every quarter to make sure they’re padded enough to absorb any price shocks. </p> <p data-seq="11">When you own stock in a company, you’re a shareholder. That means you need to stay in the loop on any information that could potentially move a stock’s price. Earnings reports tend to impact the performance of a company’s stock. </p> <p data-seq="12">A good or weak earnings report could increase trading volume and drive the stock price up or down. Earnings can sometimes be drastically different from expectations, either higher or lower. If investor sentiment is bullish and earnings are higher than analysts’ consensus, it’s likely the stock price could go higher. But if company earnings don’t meet analyst expectations, the opposite could happen. As with anything market-related, there’s no certainty.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Earnings Per Share, Profit Margins, Revenues</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share (EPS).</strong> This is a metric that gives investors a glimpse of a company’s profitability. A higher EPS is an indication of higher profitability. EPS is calculated by dividing the company’s net income by the total number of outstanding shares. It represents the part of a company’s profit that’s allocated to each share.</li><li><strong>Revenue.</strong> Total value of a company’s income from sales or services. Earnings reports include revenues because they can provide an overall view of a company’s profitability, but there’s more to a company’s profits than revenue. </li><li><strong>Profit margin.</strong> This is an indication of the financial health of a company. It’s calculated by taking the net profit and dividing it by total sales revenue, and it’s expressed as a percentage of a company’s revenues. </li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="13">Sometimes companies announce positive earnings but the stock price still falls. Maybe the earnings weren’t in line with expectations, earnings were strong but future outlook may have been revised, or the company didn’t issue any guidance about its results.   </p> <p data-seq="14">Earnings season can also set the stage for future trends across the entire market. A significant number of companies may have provided soft guidance, or maybe a specific sector is looking to cut their spending—or perhaps there’s been a drastic reduction in demand for streaming services. This type of information gives investors some idea about the overall market and the sectors within it.</p> <p data-seq="15">A company’s earnings release should help you determine if the long-term strength of your investments is still stable. If it isn’t, you might want to either sell your shares or reduce your position. You could invest the proceeds from the sale in another sector or asset class that may look more promising, or hold on to the cash until a potential investment opportunity comes up.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352084">The Bottom Line</h2>  <p data-seq="16">You want your portfolio to run relatively smoothly. If the overarching theme from earnings season indicates that trouble may be brewing, you may want to look under the hood and change out anything that needs replacing.</p> <p data-seq="17">A warning: Once you start digging into earnings reports, you might get hooked—and want deeper insight into a company’s future prospects. That means more <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/financial-ratios">metrics: price-to-earnings ratio, price/earnings-to-growth ratio, price-to-cash flow ratio</a>, and so on. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/fundamental-analysis">Fundamental analysis</a> is part math, and it also requires a bit of deductive reasoning and pattern recognition.
