No one knows what college will cost in 18 years, but it’s safe to assume it’ll stay pricey. And who says you’ll stop at one child? That’s why it’s never too early to learn about 529 education savings plans, Coverdell education savings accounts (ESAs), and other savings options.</p> <h2 id="toc-351834">Why Start Early?</h2>  <p data-seq="5"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-compounding">Compounding</a> is a phenomenon where earnings from your investments get added to your original investment pile, and those earnings then build upon themselves. Compounding is far more robust if you let it aggregate as long as possible.</p> <p data-seq="6">For example, if you start with $1,000, add $150 each month, and the account grows an average of 6% each year (tax-free in your 529), you’ll have nearly $60,000 in college funds 18 years from now. Want to see for yourself? Use the compounding calculator below. Note that the more you contribute each month, the more compounding can work its magic.</p></div><div class="Calculator_Calculator__Cvttx gigacalculator float-sm-right" data-tool="/calculators/compound-interest-calculator.php" data-testid="Calculator"><div class="gigacalctitle text-capitalize">compound interest calculator</div><div class="gigacalcfooter"><a class="text-capitalize" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/compound-interest-calculator.php">compound interest calculator</a> <!-- -->by<!-- --> <a class="gigacalclink" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/">GIGAcalculator.com</a></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><h2 id="toc-351835">529 Plans</h2>  <p data-seq="8">You can get an early start funding college through tax-advantaged savings plans. These plans, sometimes known as “qualified tuition plans,” are sponsored by states, state agencies, or educational institutions, and are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. </p> <p data-seq="9">A 529 comes in two types: education savings plans or prepaid tuition plans. All are sponsored by state governments. Here’s how they work.</p> <p data-seq="10"><strong>529 education savings plan.</strong> Regardless of the state you live in, you can open an investment account that can be used to pay tuition, fees, and room and board. Withdrawals from education savings plan accounts can generally be used at any public or private U.S. and some non-U.S. colleges or universities, with no in-state limitations and minimal impact on potential financial aid eligibility. The contribution limit is up to $16,000 annually per donor before the gift tax kicks in.</p> <p data-seq="11">You can fund a 529 plan yourself and/or get help from grandparents and others. The savings grow tax-deferred, and there’s no tax when you withdraw, provided the money is used for qualified education expenses. Many states offer tax benefits for contributions to the plans, meaning you might be able to deduct your 529 contributions from state income tax. </p> <p data-seq="12">The plans offer a range of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-are-mutual-funds">mutual funds</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/exchange-traded-funds-etfs">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>—usually conservative ones that aim to limit the risks to your college savings. The investment mix tends to tilt toward more conservative fixed-income securities as college approaches, but there aren’t any guarantees against losses. </p> <p data-seq="13">One other possible drawback of 529 savings plans is that they typically have fees and expenses that reduce your returns. There also can be penalties if you don’t use the money for education, or if you withdraw any cash early. </p> <p data-seq="14"><strong>Prepaid tuition plan.</strong> A prepaid tuition 529 plan lets you prepay your child’s future college education at current prices, but not all states have them.</p> <p data-seq="15">Some states offering these plans allow you to purchase by semester, rather than pay for all four years at once. With others you can pay by “unit,” for instance, purchasing a certain number of units of the total cost, which you can redeem in the future. Grandparents and others can also chip in.</p> <p data-seq="16">Prepaid plans, like 529 savings plans, allow the value of the education to grow tax free and are tax free when you withdraw the money, as long as it’s for education costs covered by the plan. If college costs increase 20% between the time you buy your plan and when your child begins college, that’s like making an investment with a 20% return—tax free. But there are drawbacks.</p> <p data-seq="17">You can typically only buy prepaid 529 plans for colleges and universities in your own state. As of 2022, Massachusetts is the only state allowing new investment from non-residents.</p> <p data-seq="18">If you move or if your child wants to attend an out-of-state school, the plans have contingency options, but they might include a fee. And the dollar value your plan pays might not cover the costs of college in another state. Read the fine print.</p> <p data-seq="19">Another drawback of prepaid plans versus savings plans is they typically cover only tuition and mandatory fees, not room and board. </p> <p data-seq="20"><strong>Other options.</strong> You’re not limited to one type of 529 plan. Some families have one of each for the same child, using one type of plan for tuition and fees and the other for room and board.</p> <p data-seq="21">If your child chooses not to attend college, gets a full scholarship, or attends a military school, you have options. Although the rules vary, most plans allow you to transfer the balance, without tax consequences, to another beneficiary (e.g., a sibling or other relative). You could redeem the funds, if you have no choice—but you’d owe taxes on the investments and growth, plus a 10% penalty. </p>  <h2 id="toc-351836">Coverdell Plans</h2>  <p data-seq="22">Compared with a 529, a Coverdell education savings account (ESA) is a trust or custodial account that gives you more flexibility on the investments you can make. You can even invest in individual stocks. A Coverdell ESA can also be used to pay for many K–12 expenses.</p> <p data-seq="23">Like 529 plans, Coverdell earnings and withdrawals used for qualified education costs are tax free—even tuition at a private elementary or high school. However, a Coverdell has income and contribution limits.

Withdrawals from education savings plan accounts can generally be used at any public or private U.S. and some non-U.S. colleges or universities, with no in-state limitations and minimal impact on potential financial aid eligibility. The contribution limit is up to $16,000 annually per donor before the gift tax kicks in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"11\"\u003eYou can fund a 529 plan yourself and/or get help from grandparents and others. The savings grow tax-deferred, and there’s no tax when you withdraw, provided the money is used for qualified education expenses. Many states offer tax benefits for contributions to the plans, meaning you might be able to deduct your 529 contributions from state income tax. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"12\"\u003eThe plans offer a range of \u003ca href=\"/money/what-are-mutual-funds\"\u003emutual funds\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/money/exchange-traded-funds-etfs\"\u003eexchange-traded funds (ETFs)\u003c/a\u003e—usually conservative ones that aim to limit the risks to your college savings. The investment mix tends to tilt toward more conservative fixed-income securities as college approaches, but there aren’t any guarantees against losses. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"13\"\u003eOne other possible drawback of 529 savings plans is that they typically have fees and expenses that reduce your returns. There also can be penalties if you don’t use the money for education, or if you withdraw any cash early. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"14\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrepaid tuition plan.\u003c/strong\u003e A prepaid tuition 529 plan lets you prepay your child’s future college education at current prices, but not all states have them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"15\"\u003eSome states offering these plans allow you to purchase by semester, rather than pay for all four years at once. With others you can pay by “unit,” for instance, purchasing a certain number of units of the total cost, which you can redeem in the future. Grandparents and others can also chip in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"16\"\u003ePrepaid plans, like 529 savings plans, allow the value of the education to grow tax free and are tax free when you withdraw the money, as long as it’s for education costs covered by the plan. If college costs increase 20% between the time you buy your plan and when your child begins college, that’s like making an investment with a 20% return—tax free. But there are drawbacks.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"17\"\u003eYou can typically only buy prepaid 529 plans for colleges and universities in your own state.
