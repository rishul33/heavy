investment. For many decades, mutual funds have been a mainstay of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/401k-plan">company 401(k) plans</a> and investment accounts, as they allow smaller investors to participate in a wide array of securities in one transaction. As of January 2022, U.S. investors held $27 trillion in more than 9,300 mutual funds.</p> <p data-seq="2">Looking to invest in mutual funds, or want to learn more because they’re offered as part of your retirement plan? Here’s a rundown of the basics.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Key Points</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><ul><li>The mutual fund’s prospectus lays out the objectives, costs and fees, risks, and performance.</li><li>Some funds aim to mirror the performance of a stock index, while others are actively managed.</li><li>Investors should consider the fees and taxes in a given fund before investing.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><h2 id="toc-351696">The Mutual Fund Prospectus: The Rules of Engagement</h2>  <p data-seq="3">Companies and managers who sponsor and operate mutual funds do so according to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/prospectus-definition">mutual fund’s prospectus</a>—an official document that lays out the fund’s investment objectives, costs and fees, risks, and historical performance.</p> <p data-seq="4">The prospectus defines the rules the fund will play by, including the types of investments it can hold. A fund’s choice set can be narrow—for example, it might invest only in small energy companies in South America. A fund can also be broad—for example, it might invest in anything the fund manager believes will deliver a healthy return, as long as it stays within the fund’s defined risk parameters as spelled out in the prospectus.</p> <p data-seq="5">The value of a given mutual fund (called its net asset value or NAV) goes up or down each day based on the performance of the investments it holds. The NAV is calculated daily according to the closing prices of the investments in the fund.</p>   <h2 id="toc-351697">Active vs. Passive Management</h2>  <p data-seq="6">Mutual funds are typically run by a portfolio manager who buys and sells <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/investment-types">stocks, bonds, and other fund assets</a> in a manner consistent with the fund’s strategy. Some mutual funds are actively managed, with the management team using deep research and sophisticated analytics tools to try to maximize investment returns. Actively managed funds typically charge higher fees as a way of compensating the professionals who research, select, and monitor the investments. </p> <p data-seq="7">Other funds, such as index funds, are managed more passively. The manager might invest in the components of a particular index, such as the S&amp;P 500, to mirror the performance of that index. Because passively managed funds have lower overhead, they tend to charge lower management fees.</p> <p data-seq="8">Whether a fund is passive or active, the appeal of mutual funds is the same: diversification. That is, mutual funds can help reduce the overall risk of a portfolio by investing in a variety of different stocks, bonds, and other assets.</p> <p data-seq="9">And although each fund is unique, there are a few broad categories of funds you should know about. </p>   <h2 id="toc-351698">Types of Mutual Funds</h2>  <ul><li><strong>Equity funds.</strong> These are mutual funds that invest in stocks. They can vary widely in the regions, sectors, or types of stocks they invest in. Equity funds can be actively or passively managed.</li><li><strong>Fixed-income funds.</strong> These funds invest in bonds and other securities that deliver income. They can invest in low-risk securities, like treasury bonds, or higher-risk, higher-yield securities such as corporate bonds.</li><li><strong>Money-market funds.</strong> These invest in highly conservative short-term bonds, with a goal of earning a better interest rate than the average savings account.</li><li><strong>Asset-allocation funds.</strong> These invest multiple asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, cash, and alternatives. Their objective is to reduce risk while still delivering some return. They are also known as balanced funds because they target a mix of income-producing and growth-oriented investments.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/target-date-fund">Lifecycle funds (target-date funds)</a>.</strong> This subset of asset allocation funds is popular in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/401k-plan">401(k) plans</a>. A target date fund adjusts the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents over time. The goal is to invest more aggressively in the beginning and more conservatively as retirement approaches.</li></ul>   <h2 id="toc-351699">Fees, Taxes, and Other Key Factors</h2>  <p data-seq="10">Mutual funds can seem simple, but there are a few things to keep in mind. It’s especially important to understand the fees, because they come out of the fund’s assets and thus reduce its returns over time. Here are <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/mutual-fund-fees">some common fees</a>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Management fees.</strong> This is the money the fund pays its portfolio manager and staff to buy and sell the investments in the fund.</li><li><strong>Marketing fees.</strong> Also called 12b-1 fees, these go to the fund’s manager to promote the fund or compensate the people who sell the fund.</li><li><strong>Sales load.</strong> This is the up-front commission you pay if you buy a fund through a broker or financial advisor. </li></ul> <p data-seq="11">Together, the management, 12b-1, and administrative fees add up to the mutual fund’s expense ratio, which is the annual percentage of invested assets that you as an investor would pay each year. The expense ratio is a useful way to compare the fees charged by different funds. </p> <p data-seq="12">Taxes are also a factor for mutual fund investors. You’ll have to pay annual income taxes on any interest payments or dividends you receive from a fund each year, even if that income is reinvested in the fund. You’ll also have to pay capital gains taxes on the underlying securities the fund sells for a gain during a given year. And when you sell a stock mutual fund, you’ll have to pay capital gains taxes on the returns you’ve earned.</p> <p data-seq="13">There are exceptions to these tax rules if you own the funds in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA, 401(k), or 529 plan. In tax-deferred accounts, you only owe taxes at the time you make withdrawals. The gains, losses, dividends, and interest have no tax impact until then.

Some mutual funds are actively managed, with the management team using deep research and sophisticated analytics tools to try to maximize investment returns.

The expense ratio is a useful way to compare the fees charged by different funds. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"12\"\u003eTaxes are also a factor for mutual fund investors. You’ll have to pay annual income taxes on any interest payments or dividends you receive from a fund each year, even if that income is reinvested in the fund. You’ll also have to pay capital gains taxes on the underlying securities the fund sells for a gain during a given year. And when you sell a stock mutual fund, you’ll have to pay capital gains taxes on the returns you’ve earned.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"13\"\u003eThere are exceptions to these tax rules if you own the funds in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA, 401(k), or 529 plan. In tax-deferred accounts, you only owe taxes at the time you make withdrawals. The gains, losses, dividends, and interest have no tax impact until then.
