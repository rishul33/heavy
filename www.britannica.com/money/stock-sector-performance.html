Some sectors perform better than others during a recession, while other sectors do best during economic recoveries.</p> <h2 id="toc-351974">Tracking Sector Performance</h2>  <p data-seq="4">Just as you can follow the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> (SPX) second-by-second or day-by-day, you can also track sector performance. It’s easy to find websites that track each sector throughout the trading session, daily, and over the months. Find one you like and start monitoring it regularly to get a sense of where the different sectors have been and how they’re performing. </p> <p data-seq="5">If you watch several sectors over time, they’ll tell the story of what’s happening in the economy. Here are a few recent “sector stories”:</p> <ul><li><strong>Energy.</strong> This was a dog of a sector in the 2015–20 period due to falling crude prices amid rising production, followed by sinking oil demand during COVID-19. But in 2021 and 2022, the energy sector skyrocketed amid global turmoil (Russia’s Ukraine invasion, plus a surge in demand after pandemic lockdowns ended) that raised supply concerns. Crude prices soared to $120 a barrel by the spring of 2022, nearly double the previous year’s level, boosting profit margins at big oil, natural gas, refinery, and pipeline companies. When investors see sector profits improving, they often bid up stocks in the sector. </li><li><strong>Financials.</strong> This sector, which includes the largest U.S. banks, insurance, and credit card companies, had some rough years between 2015 and 2020, hurt by a low interest rate environment as major central banks pushed borrowing costs down near zero. Low interest rates often hurt profit margins for the banks. The financial sector enjoyed a bit of a revival after COVID-19, however, when the economy got a boost from government stimulus. This heated up the housing market and led to more consumer spending, meaning more business for banks and credit card issuers. Rising interest rates starting in 2022 also supported financials. </li><li><strong>Technology.</strong> This sector was a frequent champion during the 2010–20 period, propelled by great performance from stocks such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft amid relatively strong economic growth. Then in 2022, technology took it on the chin amid rising interest rates, which tend to hurt so-called “growth” stocks that dominate the technology sector. A growth stock is one that has most of its business growth ahead and may rely on borrowing money. Because it costs more to borrow money when rates rise, that can tighten profit margins for companies with heavy debt loads.</li></ul> <p data-seq="6">Additionally, rising interest rates can hurt the home-building stocks in the consumer discretionary sector even as they help the bank stocks in the financial sector. A pandemic like COVID-19 may give consumer staples stocks a big lift as people rush out to buy toilet paper, canned food, and other essentials they need for a lockdown. But at the same time, the pandemic weighed on shares of many consumer discretionary stocks, such as restaurants, airlines, and hotels, as demand dropped. See the chart for the full snapshot of sector performance over the past 10 years.</p></div><div class="BorderlessCard_BorderlessCard__lj5NZ my-30" data-testid="BorderlessCard"><div class="w-100 position-relative d-flex"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/94/235394-159-60F03F21/Barchart-screenshot-S-and-P-500-Index.jpg?w=800" alt="Stock sector performance" data-testid="IrisImage" class="border rounded w-100"/><button class="btn CircleIconButton_CircleIconButton__BT_hg position-absolute bottom-10 right-10 bg-white btn-outline-blue-dark btn-xl btn-circle" data-testid="CircleIconButton" type="button" aria-label="Open full size image" id="_Riqm6"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="rmd-icon rmd-icon--svg" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.5 14h-.79l-.28-.27C15.41 12.59 16 11.11 16 9.5 16 5.91 13.09 3 9.5 3S3 5.91 3 9.5 5.91 16 9.5 16c1.61 0 3.09-.59 4.23-1.57l.27.28v.79l5 4.99L20.49 19l-4.99-5zm-6 0C7.01 14 5 11.99 5 9.5S7.01 5 9.5 5 14 7.01 14 9.5 11.99 14 9.5 14zm2.5-4h-2v2H9v-2H7V9h2V7h1v2h2v1z"></path></svg></button><div class="tooltip" data-testid="Tooltip">Open full sized image<div data-popper-arrow="true"></div></div></div><div class="font-serif text-gray-700 mt-5 font-14"><strong>SECTOR PERFORMANCE MATRIX.</strong> The S&amp;P 500 Index has seen strong performance over the past 10 years, but some sectors saw outsize returns while others underperformed.

Here are a couple scenarios to consider.</p> <p data-seq="9"><strong>Scenario 1: The Oil Spike</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Primary impact.</strong> Crude oil prices rocket 3% higher in a single day after news that Europe might ban imports of oil from Russia.  </li><li><strong>Secondary impact.</strong> The energy sector rallies, but there’s a plunge in the consumer discretionary sector, which includes stocks like airlines and cruise ship companies.  </li><li><strong>Why?</strong> Higher oil prices tend to help the oil companies (which can sell their product for more money) but hurt the airlines (which have to pay more for a necessary resource).</li></ul> <p data-seq="10"><strong>Scenario 2: A Red-Hot Inflation Report</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Primary impact.</strong> The latest inflation data from the U.S. government shows prices rising more than most market participants expected. </li><li><strong>Secondary impact.</strong> The real estate sector responds positively, climbing on the news. But the industrial sector has a bad day. </li><li><strong>Why?</strong> Inflation can be positive for real estate because it tends to lift home prices. Some investors buy real estate stocks during inflationary times to benefit from the rising value of homes and land. Industrial companies, however, can get hurt by inflation because it raises their input costs (the cost of supplies they need for manufacturing).</li></ul> <p data-seq="11">Sector performance isn’t always black and white.

But in 2021 and 2022, the energy sector skyrocketed amid global turmoil (Russia’s Ukraine invasion, plus a surge in demand after pandemic lockdowns ended) that raised supply concerns. Crude prices soared to $120 a barrel by the spring of 2022, nearly double the previous year’s level, boosting profit margins at big oil, natural gas, refinery, and pipeline companies. When investors see sector profits improving, they often bid up stocks in the sector. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinancials.\u003c/strong\u003e This sector, which includes the largest U.S. banks, insurance, and credit card companies, had some rough years between 2015 and 2020, hurt by a low interest rate environment as major central banks pushed borrowing costs down near zero. Low interest rates often hurt profit margins for the banks. The financial sector enjoyed a bit of a revival after COVID-19, however, when the economy got a boost from government stimulus. This heated up the housing market and led to more consumer spending, meaning more business for banks and credit card issuers. Rising interest rates starting in 2022 also supported financials. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTechnology.\u003c/strong\u003e This sector was a frequent champion during the 2010–20 period, propelled by great performance from stocks such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft amid relatively strong economic growth. Then in 2022, technology took it on the chin amid rising interest rates, which tend to hurt so-called “growth” stocks that dominate the technology sector. A growth stock is one that has most of its business growth ahead and may rely on borrowing money. Because it costs more to borrow money when rates rise, that can tighten profit margins for companies with heavy debt loads.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"6\"\u003eAdditionally, rising interest rates can hurt the home-building stocks in the consumer discretionary sector even as they help the bank stocks in the financial sector. A pandemic like COVID-19 may give consumer staples stocks a big lift as people rush out to buy toilet paper, canned food, and other essentials they need for a lockdown. But at the same time, the pandemic weighed on shares of many consumer discretionary stocks, such as restaurants, airlines, and hotels, as demand dropped.
