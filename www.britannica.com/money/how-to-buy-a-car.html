It’s about deciding whether you really need new wheels, understanding what you can afford, and knowing how to choose between a used car and a new one.</p> <p data-seq="2">Cars are so wrapped up in the American mystique that it’s hard to keep popular culture out of your decision. Maybe the idea of a new car stirs up memories of that road trip you took in college, or an image of a Hollywood icon racing down the highway. Unfortunately, the romance sometimes leads people to take on more than their wallets can handle.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-blue">Key Points</h2><div class="HouseholdFinance font-14"><ul><li>Buying a car means a host of decisions beyond “fun” stuff like color, creature comforts, gas mileage, or battery range. </li><li>You have to decide on used vs. new and learn about depreciation, insurance, loans, and more. </li><li>Supply issues and general inflation have driven new and used car prices to record levels.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">You may enjoy thinking about convertible versus hardtop, sedan versus SUV, or gas versus electric. But first, you need to consider whether a used car might be the best option, as well as the basics behind car insurance and car depreciation.</p> <h2 id="toc-352253">Take Yourself for a Test Drive</h2>  <p data-seq="4">Before kicking any tires, ask yourself a few questions:</p> <p data-seq="5"><strong>Do you really need to replace your current vehicle?</strong> Don’t let envy of your friend’s shiny new car influence your decision. Today’s cars tend to last longer than ever, with the average owner keeping their vehicle more than a decade. If your car is newer, be honest about whether you really need to replace it. For example, if repair costs are starting to add up—to the point that they cost more than a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/financing-a-car">car payment each month</a>—that could be a good reason.</p> <p data-seq="6"><strong>Should you buy an electric car?</strong> When gas costs spike, electric vehicles become tempting. Remember, though, that electrics tend to cost more, and it may take many years of fuel savings to break even. Most new electric vehicles are priced well in excess of $40,000. It’s also hard to find used ones—try finding a used Tesla, for instance. If you want to save gas, consider a used hybrid, which should be less expensive and easier to find.</p> <p data-seq="7"><strong>What features do you need?</strong> Does your old car lack modern safety features like a backup camera, blind-spot indicators, or lane-change assist? Those might be good reasons to replace a vehicle, especially if you’re buying one for a young driver like your teen or college-aged child, or if you’re in a neighborhood where lots of children play.</p> <p data-seq="8"><strong>How much can you afford?</strong> As costs rise, what you could afford last year may no longer be achievable. Affordability should include how much you can put down, as well as the monthly payment. Many financial experts suggest dedicating no more than 10% to 15% of your monthly budget on car payments. </p> <p data-seq="9"><strong>Will it add to insurance costs?</strong> Auto insurance costs are calculated by make and model, your driving record, age, gender (sorry, guys—women have fewer accidents), how many miles you drive, and even your location (accidents or thefts are more common in some areas than others). A cheaper car that’s less likely to be stolen or need expensive repairs might save you on insurance, and an older used car may not need collision coverage (although you may get dinged if it lacks modern safety features). Compare insurance costs before buying a car. </p> <p data-seq="10"><strong>Used or new?</strong> Car prices exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with new cars averaging more than $47,000. Used car prices average $27,000. That old saying—car depreciation begins the minute you drive it off the lot—is still a fact, so decide if the “new car smell” is really worth the extra cash. A used car has already had its biggest depreciation, so if you find one that’s a few years old with relatively low mileage, it might be your sweet spot. But a used car might hit you with early repair costs, so be sure to check its history, including the little things, such as how much tread is left on the tires and when the battery was last replaced.</p> <p data-seq="11"><strong>How will you use the car?</strong> For an “around-town” car, you might want something small and easy to park. If you’re doing lots of long trips, fuel economy and comfort become key. Many people spend extra on SUVs or crossovers because they’re stylish and carry lots of luggage. But these truck-like cars tend to be more expensive and get poorer mileage ratings. Before jumping on the bandwagon, consider whether a small sedan would suit your needs just as well.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352254">Do Your Research</h2>  <p data-seq="12">Create a spreadsheet of cars that meet most of your needs and prioritize by “must have,” “really want,” and “wow, this would be cool.” Good resources include Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, or the popular car magazines that review and compare models.</p></div><div class="Calculator_Calculator__Cvttx gigacalculator float-sm-right" data-tool="/calculators/loan-calculator.php" data-testid="Calculator"><div class="gigacalctitle text-capitalize">loan calculator</div><div class="gigacalcfooter"><a class="text-capitalize" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/loan-calculator.php">loan calculator</a> <!-- -->by<!-- --> <a class="gigacalclink" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/">GIGAcalculator.com</a></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="14"><strong>Using a car affordability calculator.</strong> Before you shop, get a baseline estimate using a loan calculator. Start with a round number or average, say a<strong> $20,000</strong> loan at <strong>5% interest</strong>, spread over <strong>five years</strong>. Is <strong>$377 per month</strong> doable? And remember: The lower your <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-credit-score">credit score</a>, the higher your interest rate will be.</p> <p data-seq="15">Most cars can be priced online, allowing you to “build” your model with selected features and paint color and steer you to a nearby dealer who has it in stock. This can be helpful, but it’s easy to get carried away by exciting features you don’t really need. You can open the liftgate by waving your foot under the bumper? Looks great in the commercials, but is it worth $3,500? Heated, adjustable rear seats may sound great, but how often will someone sit back there? </p> <p data-seq="16">Plus, the more you customize, the less bargaining power you’ll have. If you really want a shot at the best deal on a new car, stick to the packages with the most popular features, and those that have the most inventory on the lot. If the dealer has a dozen of the same car with the same features, they’ll be more willing to negotiate than if you absolutely, positively must have this one exact car. </p> <p data-seq="17">Also, be wary of luxury packages that cost thousands of dollars and give you lots of features you don’t necessarily want. Unfortunately, some dealers will only let you get all the latest safety features if you also buy one of these packages. Try to find a car where the most important safety features are included, but no more.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352255">Find the Best Price</h2>  <p data-seq="18">If you’re like many, price is a key consideration. Some auto manufacturers offer nonnegotiable prices. Others follow a more traditional approach, meaning dealers will haggle with you. Look for auto sales and factory incentives, because some seasons of the year tend to be better than others. </p> <p data-seq="19">These days, there’s no shortage of online resources to tell you average sales prices of new cars, safety and performance ratings, and resale value projections.

Today’s cars tend to last longer than ever, with the average owner keeping their vehicle more than a decade. If your car is newer, be honest about whether you really need to replace it. For example, if repair costs are starting to add up—to the point that they cost more than a \u003ca href=\"/money/financing-a-car\"\u003ecar payment each month\u003c/a\u003e—that could be a good reason.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShould you buy an electric car?\u003c/strong\u003e When gas costs spike, electric vehicles become tempting. Remember, though, that electrics tend to cost more, and it may take many years of fuel savings to break even. Most new electric vehicles are priced well in excess of $40,000. It’s also hard to find used ones—try finding a used Tesla, for instance. If you want to save gas, consider a used hybrid, which should be less expensive and easier to find.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"7\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat features do you need?\u003c/strong\u003e Does your old car lack modern safety features like a backup camera, blind-spot indicators, or lane-change assist? Those might be good reasons to replace a vehicle, especially if you’re buying one for a young driver like your teen or college-aged child, or if you’re in a neighborhood where lots of children play.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much can you afford?\u003c/strong\u003e As costs rise, what you could afford last year may no longer be achievable. Affordability should include how much you can put down, as well as the monthly payment. Many financial experts suggest dedicating no more than 10% to 15% of your monthly budget on car payments. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill it add to insurance costs?\u003c/strong\u003e Auto insurance costs are calculated by make and model, your driving record, age, gender (sorry, guys—women have fewer accidents), how many miles you drive, and even your location (accidents or thefts are more common in some areas than others). A cheaper car that’s less likely to be stolen or need expensive repairs might save you on insurance, and an older used car may not need collision coverage (although you may get dinged if it lacks modern safety features). Compare insurance costs before buying a car. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"10\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsed or new?\u003c/strong\u003e Car prices exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with new cars averaging more than $47,000. Used car prices average $27,000. That old saying—car depreciation begins the minute you drive it off the lot—is still a fact, so decide if the “new car smell” is really worth the extra cash. A used car has already had its biggest depreciation, so if you find one that’s a few years old with relatively low mileage, it might be your sweet spot. But a used car might hit you with early repair costs, so be sure to check its history, including the little things, such as how much tread is left on the tires and when the battery was last replaced.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"11\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will you use the car?\u003c/strong\u003e For an “around-town” car, you might want something small and easy to park. If you’re doing lots of long trips, fuel economy and comfort become key. Many people spend extra on SUVs or crossovers because they’re stylish and carry lots of luggage. But these truck-like cars tend to be more expensive and get poorer mileage ratings. Before jumping on the bandwagon, consider whether a small sedan would suit your needs just as well.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-352254\"\u003eDo Your Research\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"12\"\u003eCreate a spreadsheet of cars that meet most of your needs and prioritize by “must have,” “really want,” and “wow, this would be cool.” Good resources include Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, or the popular car magazines that review and compare models.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"type":"CALCULATOR","calculatorType":"loan-calculator","caption":"Use a loan calculator to help you estimate payments."},{"type":"HTML","content":"\u003cp data-seq=\"14\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsing a car affordability calculator.\u003c/strong\u003e Before you shop, get a baseline estimate using a loan calculator.

This can be helpful, but it’s easy to get carried away by exciting features you don’t really need. You can open the liftgate by waving your foot under the bumper? Looks great in the commercials, but is it worth $3,500? Heated, adjustable rear seats may sound great, but how often will someone sit back there? \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"16\"\u003ePlus, the more you customize, the less bargaining power you’ll have. If you really want a shot at the best deal on a new car, stick to the packages with the most popular features, and those that have the most inventory on the lot.

Unfortunately, some dealers will only let you get all the latest safety features if you also buy one of these packages. Try to find a car where the most important safety features are included, but no more.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-352255\"\u003eFind the Best Price\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"18\"\u003eIf you’re like many, price is a key consideration. Some auto manufacturers offer nonnegotiable prices. Others follow a more traditional approach, meaning dealers will haggle with you. Look for auto sales and factory incentives, because some seasons of the year tend to be better than others. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"19\"\u003eThese days, there’s no shortage of online resources to tell you average sales prices of new cars, safety and performance ratings, and resale value projections.
