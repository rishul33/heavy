It’s certainly an alluring pitch. Imagine checking out early from the soul-crushing day job to live on your terms while you’re still young. Hike the mountains, see the world, and spend time with your family. All you have to do is live frugally—well below your means—and save like crazy in the first phase of your working years. </p> <p data-seq="2">It’s not just a movement. It’s a lifestyle that, if you follow the playbook, could let you retire years—or even decades—before a traditional retirement in your 60s or 70s. FIRE adherents often set aggressive savings goals, live modestly, and invest as much as they can, while building streams of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/types-of-income">passive income</a>.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-green">Key Points</h2><div class="Retirement font-14"><ul><li>FIRE proponents spend less, save more, and target passive income, such as rental properties. </li><li>Use the formula to generate your FIRE number—an asset base from which you can live in retirement. </li><li>Inflation, market drops, and medical emergencies can derail FIRE plans.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">A 2022 spike in inflation—combined with a spate of market volatility—caused many to rethink FIRE’s feasibility. Still, the discipline that’s required—in both saving and spending—can help you hit your retirement goals. </p> <h2 id="toc-352248">How Does FIRE Work?</h2>  <p data-seq="4">With the goal of building up enough assets and passive income to retire early, many FIRE participants make drastic lifestyle changes to reach their “FIRE number”—the total amount of assets they need to walk away from the rat race. </p> <p data-seq="5">Here’s one version of the FIRE playbook: </p> <ol><li>Live frugally and save between 50% and 75% of your income.  </li><li>After <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/setting-up-emergency-fund">building an emergency fund</a>, invest your savings in a low-cost <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/stock-market-index#ref351972">index fund</a>, usually one that tracks the S&amp;P 500.  </li><li>Work to build <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/types-of-income">passive income</a> by starting a business or buying property and renting it out. Regular cash flow can be built over time to support a retirement lifestyle. Plus, additional income is invested to reach your FIRE number later.</li></ol> <p data-seq="6">The idea is that after reaching your target number for FIRE, you can quit your job and pursue your passions, such as a less lucrative but more meaningful career, staying home to raise your family, volunteering, or buying a tiny house and living off the nest egg.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352249">How to Determine Your FIRE Number</h2>  <p data-seq="7">To figure out how much you need to retire, do a quick calculation. Figure out how much you need to live on for a year and multiply that by 25. For example, if you need $60,000 a year—over and above other income sources—to live comfortably and meet your goals, you need to save up $1.5 million before you retire. </p> <p data-seq="8">The FIRE number calculation is similar to the math behind the 4% rule of retirement. According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/4-percent-rule-retirement">the 4% rule</a>, by withdrawing roughly 4% or less per year from your savings, adjusted for inflation, you can raise the probability that your savings may last several decades.</p> <p data-seq="9">Now let’s do another calculation. If you need to save $1.5 million in order to retire early, and you’re saving over a period of only 15 years (ages 25 to 40, let’s say), your savings (plus your investment earnings) would need to average $100,000 per year. </p> <p data-seq="10"><strong>Reality check:</strong> That’s a lot of money. Unless you’re a high wage earner in your early years, have an inheritance or a trust fund, or invested in the right start-ups or <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-cryptocurrency">cryptocurrencies</a>, an early checkout from the workforce might not be feasible. </p> <p data-seq="11">Not every FIRE participant uses 4% or the 25X calculation as a hard-and-fast rule. Many FIRE participants assume they’ll supplement their investment portfolio with passive income or some type of meaningful work. Other members of the FIRE movement don’t mind drawing down their portfolios during their early retirement. And the risk of outliving their money? They’ll cross that bridge if and when they come to it.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352250">FIRE Strategies and Variations</h2>  <p data-seq="12">FIRE isn’t one-size-fits-all. The basic strategies for FIRE include:</p> <ul><li>Decreased spending</li><li>Aggressive saving</li><li>Investing</li><li>Passive income development</li></ul> <p data-seq="13">However, not everyone follows the same path to FIRE. Over the years, different variations have emerged in the movement, with participants tailoring their approach based on income, family situation, and other factors.</p> <p data-seq="14"><strong>Lean FIRE</strong></p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li><strong>Goal:</strong> Retire early and live a lavish lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Approach:</strong> Aggressive savings and development of passive income to amass a large portfolio. Often, this requires working longer hours and creating a side hustle or building a real estate empire.</li></ul> <p data-seq="15"><strong>Fat FIRE</strong></p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li><strong>Goal:</strong> Retire early and live modestly. </li><li><strong>Approach:</strong> Keep costs low in retirement so it’s possible to live on less. This approach focuses on frugality and a low cost of living.</li></ul> <p data-seq="16"><strong>Barista FIRE</strong></p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li><strong>Goal:</strong> Quit your current job and work part-time.</li><li><strong>Approach:</strong> Figure out how much you need in your portfolio to cover some of your living expenses while working part-time. For some barista FIRE participants, the idea is to be able to choose more meaningful work or cut back on their hours. The FIRE number for barista FIRE is often lower than for lean or fat versions.</li></ul> <p data-seq="17"><strong>Slow FIRE</strong></p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li><strong>Goal:</strong> Reach financial independence, but without the need to alter your current lifestyle drastically.</li><li><strong>Approach:</strong> Rather than trying to retire in your 30s or 40s, participants in slow FIRE often aim for financial independence by a later date (although still earlier than traditional retirement). Slow FIRE participants often have a lower savings rate and avoid having to sacrifice too much to achieve financial independence.</li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-352251">Pros and Cons of the FIRE Movement</h2>  <p data-seq="18"><strong>Pros of FIRE</strong></p> <ul><li>FIRE strategies can benefit everyone, even if early retirement isn’t the goal. </li><li>You have a better chance of reaching some level of financial independence when following FIRE strategies. </li><li>It’s possible to tweak FIRE strategies to fit your personal goals and financial situation.</li></ul> <p data-seq="19"><strong>Cons of FIRE</strong></p> <ul class="list-unstyled"><li>A big market drop when you’re ready to retire early could derail your plan, force you to dip into your principal, and make your portfolio inadequate. </li><li>High inflation rates—like those experienced in the early 2020s—can erode your ability to maintain your lifestyle after retiring early. </li><li>If you have kids or other family obligations, it might not be practical to have a high savings rate without a great deal of sacrifice. </li><li>Using the 25X calculation, your money might last only 20 to 40 years.
