But as you wrestle with the idea of paying for college, you might wonder about your financial readiness. The good news: Even if you haven’t been able to save enough, it’s not too late to help your student receive a good education without getting crushed by debt.</p> <p data-seq="2">Although kids go through plenty of hoops building their academic and extracurricular records, parents have their own brand of pre-college anxiety. Much of it, unfortunately, revolves around money, and often depends on decisions you made when your teen was a baby. If you began saving for college early with a 529 savings or prepaid tuition plan, you may be able to pay for at least part of a college education for one or more of your kids.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-blue">Key Points</h2><div class="HouseholdFinance font-14"><ul><li>Even if your child is in high school and you haven’t yet saved enough for college, there are steps you can take to prepare. </li><li>Learn the total cost of attendance and know your own budget to determine how much financial aid your high schooler may receive. </li><li>Talk to your child about setting expectations and options for a cheaper education, especially if you worry about finances.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">If you started late, don’t be hard on yourself. Just prepare for a rougher road, including the need to manage expectations—your own and your teen’s. More than half of college graduates finish with at least some debt, averaging about $29,000 as of 2022. Although a little debt can be manageable, it will be a drag on your child’s financial future until it’s paid off. </p> <p data-seq="4">Don’t wait to talk to your child about the tough choices ahead. The earlier they’re aware of financial limitations, the better. There also are important steps you can take to make college more affordable. But first, the talk.</p> <h2 id="toc-352192">Conversation Starters: Questions to Ask Your High Schooler</h2>  <p data-seq="5">If you’re worried about college costs, here are some questions to discuss with your child a few years before high school graduation. Once you get the dialogue going, you’ll learn what your child wants and can begin to set expectations in line with your financial reality.</p> <ul><li><strong>Is traditional college necessary?</strong> Your child may not have career goals yet, but it’s never too soon to contemplate if they need a college degree to succeed in their field of choice. </li><li><strong>Is community college an option?</strong> Many provide excellent education at low prices. A couple of years at a community college could provide a springboard to two years at a traditional college. </li><li><strong>What about state school versus private school?</strong> Private schools cost a fortune—up to four times the cost of an in-state public school. Is it worth the added cost? Although many private colleges are “brand names,” so are many public universities. Plus, a big state school offers opportunities in and out of the classroom that many smaller private schools can’t. If finances are an issue, make sure your child knows as soon as possible that a public education is likely the best choice.  </li><li><strong>What about a “gap” year?</strong> Your child could intern or volunteer in a field of interest while your family gets an extra year to save for tuition and research the best college choices. </li><li><strong>How much can your child contribute?</strong> Many families ask children to work summer or on-campus jobs to help pay bills. This may cut into leisure or study time, but many successful people worked their way through college and are proud of it. </li><li><strong>Would your child consider the military?</strong> Joining the armed forces is a massive commitment, but the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/GI-Bill-of-Rights">G.I. Bill</a> and campus <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Reserve-Officers-Training-Corps">ROTC</a> programs will pay up to 100% of college tuition, fees, and even a monthly stipend.</li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-352193">Breaking Down Costs</h2>  <p data-seq="6">How much does a state college cost? What’s the cost of a community college? </p> <p data-seq="7">In 2022, tuition averaged $10,700 per semester at public four-year colleges and about $38,000 at private nonprofit institutions. But even public colleges in the same state can differ. For example, in-state tuition at different University of Illinois campuses in 2022–23 ranges from roughly $9,000 to $12,000. Yes, some are considered more “elite” than others, but all provide degrees. Meanwhile, a solid community college can cost less than $4,000 a year for in-state tuition.</p> <p data-seq="8">Tuition accounts for most of the cost of attendance (COA) of college, but COA also includes room and board, books, and fees. Down the road, your <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/fafsa-college-financial-aid">expected family contribution (EFC) subtracted from the college’s total COA helps determine financial aid. </a></p> <p data-seq="9">Also consider distance. Do you need to pad an airline CEO’s bonus? A local college saves money. So does having your child live at home the first year or two, if feasible.</p> <p data-seq="10">Consider tuition prep your homework assignment, but keep your child informed. Check costs versus what you think you can afford, any college savings, and your household budget.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352194">Making the Grade: Your Kid’s Contribution</h2>  <p data-seq="11">While you explore tuition and budget, your child can up their financial game.</p> <p data-seq="12"><strong>AP credits.</strong> Most colleges and universities provide credit for students who take and excel in high school advanced placement (AP) courses. Your child’s counselor may already have discussed this with you, but if not, make an appointment. </p> <p data-seq="13">Strong AP test scores can provide advanced placement at some colleges, allowing students to skip introductory courses. That’s free college credit that may also reduce the time it takes to complete a degree.</p> <p data-seq="14"><strong>Community college credits.</strong> Some students get ahead by grabbing “dual” credits at a local community college while still in high school.</p> <p data-seq="15"><strong>Creative counseling.</strong> You and your child should be best friends with the high school college counselor. A good one can identify the colleges most likely to give your child a discount, including which ones tend to seek students from your specific school or your area. </p> <p data-seq="16">Although this applies more to smaller colleges than big ones, many competitive schools—state and private—seek diversity in their student bodies. Having a talent, being from a certain part of the country, or participating in the right extracurriculars can bring a generous financial offer.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352195">The Bottom Line</h2>  <p data-seq="17">Yes, getting your child and your finances into college readiness mode isn’t a cakewalk. And it’s not over yet, because once your child starts applying to schools, you’ll have to get ready to cash those 529s, apply for financial aid, and narrow down the choices.
