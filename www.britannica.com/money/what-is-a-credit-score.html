You can find the answer in your three-digit credit score. If you have a good credit score, you can expect to see lower loan rates and smaller rent deposits. </p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-blue">Key Points</h2><div class="HouseholdFinance font-14"><ul><li>Your credit score is based on information in your credit report.</li><li>Factors affecting your credit score include payment history, percentage utilization, and new applications.</li><li>In general, a credit score below 580 is poor and anything above 800 is excellent.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">Here’s what you need to know about credit scores.</p> <h2 id="toc-351934">What Is a Credit Score?</h2>  <p data-seq="4">A credit score is designed to give lenders and other financial service providers a quick look at how you handle credit. Information from your credit report (or credit history) is fed into a complicated mathematical formula, and the result is your credit score.</p> <p data-seq="5">The most widely used credit score is the FICO score, designed by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This model gives you a score between 300 and 850. The higher your score, the lower the credit risk you present to a lender. Other people, like landlords, might also pull your credit to determine whether they think you’re likely to make your rent payments on time.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351935">What Factors Determine Your Credit Score?</h2>  <p data-seq="6">Five main factors are used in your FICO score. Other credit scoring models might emphasize factors differently, or they might use additional factors. For the most part, though, you can expect the following to affect your score:</p> <ul><li><strong>Payment history.</strong> Whether you pay on time and in full each month is the most important factor in your credit score, accounting for about 35% of the total.</li><li><strong>Credit utilization.</strong> About 30% of your score is influenced by how much of your available credit card balances you’re using. For example, if you have a credit line of $2,000 and you have a balance of $500, your credit utilization is 25%. It’s best to pay off your credit cards each month. Once you get above 30% credit utilization, you’re likely to see a bigger negative impact.</li><li><strong>Length of credit history.</strong> How long you’ve had credit, and the average age of your accounts, is the next important factor, making up 15% of your credit score.</li><li><strong>Credit mix.</strong> Your credit score also takes into account whether you have a mix of revolving and installment credit. Revolving credit consists of accounts where you have a maximum credit line and can pay as you go. Credit cards are revolving accounts. Installment accounts have fixed payments and a set paydown schedule, such as a car loan. Your credit mix makes up about 10% of your credit score.</li><li><strong>New credit.</strong> Finally, whether you’ve applied for many loans in a short time accounts for 10% of your credit score.</li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-351936">Why Are My Credit Scores Different?</h2>  <p data-seq="7">You’ve probably noticed you have different credit scores. That’s because the information in your credit report is voluntarily provided by lenders. Some creditors and lenders report only to one of the three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion), while others report to all of them.</p> <p data-seq="8">Sometimes information is reported at different times. For example, if a credit card issuer reports your balance in the middle of the month, it might look like you’re using a lot of your available credit line. This could drag down your credit score. </p> <p data-seq="9">On the other hand, if your information is reported right after you make a credit card payment, it shows that you’re using a smaller percentage of your line, which would make your score a bit higher.</p> <p data-seq="10">Each score is based on the information from a credit report. So if you’re looking at your FICO score, you might see an Equifax score and a TransUnion score.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351937">Are There Alternatives to the FICO Score?</h2>  <p data-seq="11">Your credit report can be used in other credit scoring models. For example, some banks take the basic formula provided by companies like FICO and then tweak them based on different risk factors and the type of loan you’re applying for. The modified formula might be used specifically for a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/common-mortgage-terms">home mortgage</a> or car loan. Each of those scores would be different, and they’d be different from your FICO score. </p> <p data-seq="12">Free consumer websites such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame might use scoring models that differ from the models used by banks.</p> <p data-seq="13">In addition, the three major credit reporting agencies created the VantageScore, which highlights different information from FICO. But the VantageScore isn’t used as widely.</p> <p data-seq="14">Finally, depending on the state you live in, your credit report might be used to calculate an “insurance score,” which auto insurance companies use to set your premium.  </p>  <h2 id="toc-351938">How Do I Know If I Have Good Credit?</h2>  <p data-seq="15">To qualify for the best credit card deals and get the lowest mortgage or car loan rates, you need a higher credit score. When looking at FICO scores, there are different ranges that indicate whether you have “good” or “bad” credit.</p> <ul><li><strong>Excellent:</strong> 800 and above</li><li><strong>Very good:</strong> 740–799</li><li><strong>Good:</strong> 670–739</li><li><strong>Fair:</strong> 580–669</li><li><strong>Poor:</strong> Below 580</li></ul> <p data-seq="16">In most cases, you can get a credit card or car loan with fair credit. If you want access to the best rewards credit cards, you’ll likely need a credit score above 670.

Information from your credit report (or credit history) is fed into a complicated mathematical formula, and the result is your credit score.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"5\"\u003eThe most widely used credit score is the FICO score, designed by the Fair Isaac Corporation. This model gives you a score between 300 and 850. The higher your score, the lower the credit risk you present to a lender. Other people, like landlords, might also pull your credit to determine whether they think you’re likely to make your rent payments on time.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351935\"\u003eWhat Factors Determine Your Credit Score?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"6\"\u003eFive main factors are used in your FICO score. Other credit scoring models might emphasize factors differently, or they might use additional factors. For the most part, though, you can expect the following to affect your score:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePayment history.\u003c/strong\u003e Whether you pay on time and in full each month is the most important factor in your credit score, accounting for about 35% of the total.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredit utilization.\u003c/strong\u003e About 30% of your score is influenced by how much of your available credit card balances you’re using. For example, if you have a credit line of $2,000 and you have a balance of $500, your credit utilization is 25%. It’s best to pay off your credit cards each month. Once you get above 30% credit utilization, you’re likely to see a bigger negative impact.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLength of credit history.\u003c/strong\u003e How long you’ve had credit, and the average age of your accounts, is the next important factor, making up 15% of your credit score.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredit mix.\u003c/strong\u003e Your credit score also takes into account whether you have a mix of revolving and installment credit. Revolving credit consists of accounts where you have a maximum credit line and can pay as you go. Credit cards are revolving accounts. Installment accounts have fixed payments and a set paydown schedule, such as a car loan. Your credit mix makes up about 10% of your credit score.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew credit.\u003c/strong\u003e Finally, whether you’ve applied for many loans in a short time accounts for 10% of your credit score.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351936\"\u003eWhy Are My Credit Scores Different?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"7\"\u003eYou’ve probably noticed you have different credit scores. That’s because the information in your credit report is voluntarily provided by lenders. Some creditors and lenders report only to one of the three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion), while others report to all of them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"8\"\u003eSometimes information is reported at different times. For example, if a credit card issuer reports your balance in the middle of the month, it might look like you’re using a lot of your available credit line. This could drag down your credit score. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"9\"\u003eOn the other hand, if your information is reported right after you make a credit card payment, it shows that you’re using a smaller percentage of your line, which would make your score a bit higher.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"10\"\u003eEach score is based on the information from a credit report. So if you’re looking at your FICO score, you might see an Equifax score and a TransUnion score.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351937\"\u003eAre There Alternatives to the FICO Score?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"11\"\u003eYour credit report can be used in other credit scoring models. For example, some banks take the basic formula provided by companies like FICO and then tweak them based on different risk factors and the type of loan you’re applying for. The modified formula might be used specifically for a \u003ca href=\"/money/common-mortgage-terms\"\u003ehome mortgage\u003c/a\u003e or car loan. Each of those scores would be different, and they’d be different from your FICO score. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"12\"\u003eFree consumer websites such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame might use scoring models that differ from the models used by banks.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"13\"\u003eIn addition, the three major credit reporting agencies created the VantageScore, which highlights different information from FICO. But the VantageScore isn’t used as widely.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"14\"\u003eFinally, depending on the state you live in, your credit report might be used to calculate an “insurance score,” which auto insurance companies use to set your premium.  \u003c/p\u003e  \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351938\"\u003eHow Do I Know If I Have Good Credit?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"15\"\u003eTo qualify for the best credit card deals and get the lowest mortgage or car loan rates, you need a higher credit score.
