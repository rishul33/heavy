There are several reasons to consider participating in your 401(k) at work, from tax advantages to employer-matched contributions and more.</p> <p data-seq="2">Here’s a quick guide to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-green">Key Points</h2><div class="Retirement font-14"><ul><li>Contributing to an employer-sponsored 401(k) is one of the simplest and most effective ways to save and invest for retirement.</li><li>You’ll need to make some basic decisions, like how much to save and how to invest your money. </li><li>If your employer matches funds, learn how to maximize this benefit.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><h2 id="toc-351715">What Is a 401(k) Plan?</h2>  <p data-seq="3">A 401(k) plan is a retirement savings account offered through your employer. Once you’ve signed up for the plan (if your employer hasn’t done it for you), you can contribute a portion of every paycheck into a 401(k) account and select specific investments from an approved list. In some cases, your employer may match your 401(k) contributions, up to a certain percentage of your paycheck.</p>   <h2 id="toc-351716">How Does a 401(k) Plan Work?</h2>  <p data-seq="4">Your employer-sponsored 401(k) is designed to help you save for retirement and enjoy tax benefits while you’re at it. But there are a few things you need to know.</p>   <h2 id="toc-351717">401(k) Eligibility</h2>  <p data-seq="5">You may be eligible to participate in the 401(k) right away, or there might be a waiting period. Your company’s human resources department can tell you when you can start participating. Once you’re all set up, the money is usually taken out of your paycheck automatically.  </p>   <h2 id="toc-351718">Traditional vs. Roth 401(k)</h2>  <p data-seq="6">Depending on the plans your employer offers, you may have the opportunity to contribute to a traditional or a Roth 401(k). If both are offered, you may be able to split your contributions between the two. Although both plans offer tax benefits, your contributions and withdrawals are taxed in different ways.</p> <p data-seq="7">With a traditional 401(k), the money comes out of your paycheck before taxes. That means if you contribute $100 per paycheck, the $100 comes out of your paycheck before taxes are calculated, which reduces your income tax bill for the year. However, you’ll be taxed on your withdrawals from the traditional 401(k) after you retire. (If you tap your savings before you reach age 59 1/2, you may also have to pay early withdrawal penalties.)  </p> <p data-seq="8">With a Roth 401(k), you’ll pay taxes on your entire paycheck, before your Roth contributions are deducted. Instead, your savings and investment earnings grow tax free, and you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals made after age 59 1/2. </p> <p data-seq="9">When deciding whether to contribute to a traditional or Roth 401(k), you’ll need to consider your age and your current tax bracket, as well as your potential tax situation when you retire. Does it make more sense to pay taxes now or later? If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket after retirement, you might prefer to pay taxes on withdrawals (traditional IRA). If you think your tax bracket is lower now than it may be in the future, it might make sense to pay the taxes now (Roth IRA) and take tax-free distributions in retirement. </p>   <h2 id="toc-351719">401(k) Investments</h2>  <p data-seq="10">Your employer may offer several types of investments in their 401(k), including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Mutual funds are groups of stocks and bonds you can buy all at once, making it easy to create a diversified portfolio. </p> <p data-seq="11">The plan may also include target-date funds, which are “funds of funds” managed by professionals who adjust the risk level over time. Usually, these funds are more aggressive (i.e., risky) in the near term, then ratchet down the risk (and the returns) as the “target date” approaches to provide a more stable portfolio. Choosing a target date fund is simple: You decide when you plan to retire, then choose the fund with the corresponding date.</p> <p data-seq="12">The investment choices you make will depend on how much risk you’re comfortable with and your retirement goals. Pay careful attention to any fees, because they can <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/mutual-fund-fees">really add up over the years</a>.</p> <p data-seq="13">Remember that you’re investing for the long term. The idea is that by the time you retire, you’ll have a sizable cash stash that can provide you a healthy income.  </p>   <h2 id="toc-351720">401(k) Contribution Limits</h2>  <p data-seq="14">How much you’re able to contribute to your employer’s 401(k) may depend on the plan, your income, and established IRS limits. </p> <p data-seq="15">For the 2022 tax year, you can contribute up to $20,500 from your paychecks into your 401(k) account. If you’re age 50 or older, you can make additional catch-up contributions of up to $6,500.</p>   <h2 id="toc-351721">Employer 401(k) Match</h2>  <p data-seq="16">Your employer may also make contributions to your 401(k) on your behalf. Some companies match a percentage of your contribution, such as 100% on the first 3% you contribute. Or your employer may opt to match a portion of your salary. You won’t pay taxes on the employer contributions until you withdraw the funds in retirement, so matched funds are treated like a traditional (non-Roth) 401(k).</p> <p data-seq="17">Generally, it’s a good idea to contribute at least enough to get the full match from your employer. After all, it’s like getting free money just by saving for retirement. For example, suppose your employer matches your annual contributions up to 3% of your salary. If you make $40,000, then your employer will contribute $1,200 to the plan for you, as long as you contribute at least $1,200 of your own salary (that’s $2,400 added to your nest egg).</p>   <h2 id="toc-351722">Vesting</h2>  <p data-seq="18">The money you contribute to your 401(k) always belongs to you. That may not be the case with your employer’s contributions, however.

Once you’ve signed up for the plan (if your employer hasn’t done it for you), you can contribute a portion of every paycheck into a 401(k) account and select specific investments from an approved list. In some cases, your employer may match your 401(k) contributions, up to a certain percentage of your paycheck.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351716\"\u003eHow Does a 401(k) Plan Work?\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"4\"\u003eYour employer-sponsored 401(k) is designed to help you save for retirement and enjoy tax benefits while you’re at it. But there are a few things you need to know.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351717\"\u003e401(k) Eligibility\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"5\"\u003eYou may be eligible to participate in the 401(k) right away, or there might be a waiting period. Your company’s human resources department can tell you when you can start participating. Once you’re all set up, the money is usually taken out of your paycheck automatically.  \u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351718\"\u003eTraditional vs. Roth 401(k)\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"6\"\u003eDepending on the plans your employer offers, you may have the opportunity to contribute to a traditional or a Roth 401(k). If both are offered, you may be able to split your contributions between the two. Although both plans offer tax benefits, your contributions and withdrawals are taxed in different ways.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"7\"\u003eWith a traditional 401(k), the money comes out of your paycheck before taxes. That means if you contribute $100 per paycheck, the $100 comes out of your paycheck before taxes are calculated, which reduces your income tax bill for the year. However, you’ll be taxed on your withdrawals from the traditional 401(k) after you retire. (If you tap your savings before you reach age 59 1/2, you may also have to pay early withdrawal penalties.)  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"8\"\u003eWith a Roth 401(k), you’ll pay taxes on your entire paycheck, before your Roth contributions are deducted. Instead, your savings and investment earnings grow tax free, and you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals made after age 59 1/2. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"9\"\u003eWhen deciding whether to contribute to a traditional or Roth 401(k), you’ll need to consider your age and your current tax bracket, as well as your potential tax situation when you retire. Does it make more sense to pay taxes now or later? If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket after retirement, you might prefer to pay taxes on withdrawals (traditional IRA). If you think your tax bracket is lower now than it may be in the future, it might make sense to pay the taxes now (Roth IRA) and take tax-free distributions in retirement. \u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351719\"\u003e401(k) Investments\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"10\"\u003eYour employer may offer several types of investments in their 401(k), including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Mutual funds are groups of stocks and bonds you can buy all at once, making it easy to create a diversified portfolio. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"11\"\u003eThe plan may also include target-date funds, which are “funds of funds” managed by professionals who adjust the risk level over time. Usually, these funds are more aggressive (i.e., risky) in the near term, then ratchet down the risk (and the returns) as the “target date” approaches to provide a more stable portfolio. Choosing a target date fund is simple: You decide when you plan to retire, then choose the fund with the corresponding date.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"12\"\u003eThe investment choices you make will depend on how much risk you’re comfortable with and your retirement goals. Pay careful attention to any fees, because they can \u003ca href=\"/money/mutual-fund-fees\"\u003ereally add up over the years\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"13\"\u003eRemember that you’re investing for the long term. The idea is that by the time you retire, you’ll have a sizable cash stash that can provide you a healthy income.  \u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351720\"\u003e401(k) Contribution Limits\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"14\"\u003eHow much you’re able to contribute to your employer’s 401(k) may depend on the plan, your income, and established IRS limits. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"15\"\u003eFor the 2022 tax year, you can contribute up to $20,500 from your paychecks into your 401(k) account. If you’re age 50 or older, you can make additional catch-up contributions of up to $6,500.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351721\"\u003eEmployer 401(k) Match\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"16\"\u003eYour employer may also make contributions to your 401(k) on your behalf. Some companies match a percentage of your contribution, such as 100% on the first 3% you contribute. Or your employer may opt to match a portion of your salary. You won’t pay taxes on the employer contributions until you withdraw the funds in retirement, so matched funds are treated like a traditional (non-Roth) 401(k).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp data-seq=\"17\"\u003eGenerally, it’s a good idea to contribute at least enough to get the full match from your employer. After all, it’s like getting free money just by saving for retirement. For example, suppose your employer matches your annual contributions up to 3% of your salary. If you make $40,000, then your employer will contribute $1,200 to the plan for you, as long as you contribute at least $1,200 of your own salary (that’s $2,400 added to your nest egg).\u003c/p\u003e   \u003ch2 id=\"toc-351722\"\u003eVesting\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cp data-seq=\"18\"\u003eThe money you contribute to your 401(k) always belongs to you.
