data-seq="1">What will the price of a barrel of oil be in six months? How much will a bushel of wheat set you back a year from now? Nobody knows for sure. But such questions are why futures markets and futures contracts exist.</p> <p data-seq="2">Futures markets are a mechanism through which investors and traders track the fair value of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/investment-types">financial assets</a>—<a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-are-commodities">commodities</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/stock-market-index">stock indexes</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/how-interest-rates-work">interest rates</a>, and others—weeks, months, or years down the road. Futures contracts are actively traded on exchanges, just like stocks, but that’s pretty much where the similarities end.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Key Points</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><ul><li>Futures contracts are standardized and fungible, allowing for a seamless transfer of ownership when buying and selling.</li><li>Exchanges list futures contracts, hedgers use them to offset risk, and speculators buy and sell them in search of short-term profits. </li><li>Futures margin allows traders to control more notional value with a small up-front deposit, but margin can magnify losses as well as profits.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><h2 id="toc-352075">What Is a Futures Contract?</h2>  <p data-seq="3">When you buy or sell a futures contract, you enter a legal agreement that spells out standardized specifics and obligations. For example, one West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract is based on 1,000 barrels of oil to be “delivered” by a certain date at a certain price at a certain geographic location (a major oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, in the case of WTI futures). In another example, one futures contract based on corn represents 5,000 bushels of the grain.</p> <p data-seq="4">Standardization is the key to futures, as it makes each contract “fungible” with all other contracts of that delivery date. You can buy and sell contracts knowing that each one is the same. </p> <p data-seq="5">Actual delivery of commodities such as oil, copper or cattle is infrequent. The overwhelming majority of futures contracts are liquidated—sold or bought back to close out the position—well before the final delivery date, when the contract officially expires. The buyer or seller may have been using futures to hedge, or protect, their business against adverse price swings—say, a farmer seeking to lock in a specific corn price before the actual harvest. </p> <p data-seq="6">Futures can be also used to speculate on the price of a commodity or on the direction of interest rates or equity benchmarks like the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong>.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352076">Who Are the Futures “Players”?</h2>  <p data-seq="7"><strong>Exchanges.</strong> Futures, like stocks, are mostly traded electronically on exchanges (CME Group is the largest U.S.-based futures exchange operator). Futures exchanges perform similar functions to stock exchanges, providing a centralized forum for buyers and sellers to conduct business. The futures exchanges also play an important role as a “backstop” to every trade, guaranteeing that a contract will be honored and reducing so-called counterparty risk.</p> <p data-seq="8"><strong>Commercial entities.</strong> Futures are traded by a variety of people and businesses for a variety of reasons. The aforementioned farmer may use futures to protect her business in case a major drought cuts the harvest. Oil companies are active players in energy markets, as they seek to insulate against expected events that may affect oil or natural-gas prices. These are examples of end users, or “commercials.”</p> <p data-seq="9"><strong>Speculators.</strong> Some futures participants have no interest in owning the actual commodity. They’re called speculators, and they’re in it to “buy low, sell high,” or the other way around, as they try to take advantage of price gyrations. (Yes; futures traders can initiate a futures position with a “sell” order just as easily as with a “buy” order.) Combined, the speculators and commercials provide critical liquidity for a properly functioning futures markets, ensuring there are sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers (again, similar to stocks).</p>  <h2 id="toc-352077">Gauges of Sentiment, Economic Health</h2>  <p data-seq="10">Actively traded futures markets based on commodities like crude oil, copper, gold, and grain, along with futures based on interest rate benchmarks (such as the 10-year treasury note) or stock indexes (like the S&amp;P 500) are widely followed by investing and market professionals as gauges and bellwethers for the economy’s health, consumer behavior and sentiment, food supplies and prices, and more.</p> <p data-seq="11">Individual investors don’t have to trade futures to gain useful insights from these markets. Take crude oil, for example. Oil soared above $100 a barrel during summer 2022, driving up pump gasoline prices and contributing to consumer inflation that had been running at four-decade highs. How long might that trend continue?</p> <p data-seq="12">A look at the forward curve—a listing of several futures contract months on a chart—can give you a bit of insight. Note that, in the table below, the near-term delivery months were trading well above those of longer-dated futures contracts. </p></div><div class="BorderlessCard_BorderlessCard__lj5NZ my-30" data-testid="BorderlessCard"><div class="w-100 position-relative d-flex"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/92/235392-159-A10C08DF/Barchart-screenshot-Crude-Oil-WTI-Sep-22-CLU22.jpg?w=800" alt="Crude oil futures contracts" data-testid="IrisImage" class="border rounded w-100"/><button class="btn CircleIconButton_CircleIconButton__BT_hg position-absolute bottom-10 right-10 bg-white btn-outline-blue-dark btn-xl btn-circle" data-testid="CircleIconButton" type="button" aria-label="Open full size image" id="_Riqm6"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="rmd-icon rmd-icon--svg" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.5 14h-.79l-.28-.27C15.41 12.59 16 11.11 16 9.5 16 5.91 13.09 3 9.5 3S3 5.91 3 9.5 5.91 16 9.5 16c1.61 0 3.09-.59 4.23-1.57l.27.28v.79l5 4.99L20.49 19l-4.99-5zm-6 0C7.01 14 5 11.99 5 9.5S7.01 5 9.5 5 14 7.01 14 9.5 11.99 14 9.5 14zm2.5-4h-2v2H9v-2H7V9h2V7h1v2h2v1z"></path></svg></button><div class="tooltip" data-testid="Tooltip">Open full sized image<div data-popper-arrow="true"></div></div></div><div class="font-serif text-gray-700 mt-5 font-14"><strong>FORWARD AND DOWNWARD.</strong> Where might commodity prices be next year or the year after that?

For example, one West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract is based on 1,000 barrels of oil to be “delivered” by a certain date at a certain price at a certain geographic location (a major oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, in the case of WTI futures).

The aforementioned farmer may use futures to protect her business in case a major drought cuts the harvest.
