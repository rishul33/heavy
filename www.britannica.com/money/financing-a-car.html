Financing a car isn’t as fun as choosing the paint color, but it’s far more essential. Learning how car loans work, figuring out your credit score to buy a car, and determining your car payment all need ironing out before you drive off the lot.</p> <p data-seq="2">Hopefully you’ve <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/how-to-buy-a-car">done the research and figured out what kind of car you need</a>, but if not, make sure you’ve answered all those questions and narrowed down your list to a few logical vehicles before you begin actively shopping for a loan.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-blue">Key Points</h2><div class="HouseholdFinance font-14"><ul><li>Knowing your credit score, deciding your down payment, and getting preapproved can all make financing a car a simpler process. </li><li>The cost of car loans has been rising, and your rate could be higher without a solid credit score. </li><li>There’s more than one place to shop for a car loan, including the dealer or a bank or credit union.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><h2 id="toc-352257">Financing Your Car Purchase?</h2>  <p data-seq="3">Although some buyers have enough cash to pay for a car up front, the overwhelming majority—85% of new vehicle buyers and 39% of used vehicle buyers in 2021—choose to finance their auto purchase. That’s not surprising, with new cars averaging more than $47,000 and even used car prices averaging $27,000.</p> <p data-seq="4">If financing is on the menu, you have many options. You can take the dealer financing (remember to discuss incentives). Or you can deal through your bank or credit union, which might have special rates for existing customers.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352258">The 20/4/10 Rule</h2>  <p data-seq="5">Money pros used to have a car financing maxim known as the 20/4/10 rule—that is, no less than a 20% down payment, for a term of no longer than four years, and your payments shouldn’t require more than 10% of your income. </p> <p data-seq="6">While 20/4/10 might feel obsolete, or not applicable to your circumstances, it’s a good target to aim for.  You won’t know the exact payments until you meet with the bank or dealer finance manager, so you should start with a ballpark estimate. Use a  loan calculator, like the one below, to help you get started.</p></div><div class="Calculator_Calculator__Cvttx gigacalculator float-sm-right" data-tool="/calculators/loan-calculator.php" data-testid="Calculator"><div class="gigacalctitle text-capitalize">loan calculator</div><div class="gigacalcfooter"><a class="text-capitalize" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/loan-calculator.php">loan calculator</a> <!-- -->by<!-- --> <a class="gigacalclink" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/">GIGAcalculator.com</a></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="8"><strong>How much can you afford?</strong> Plug in the <strong>amount of your loan</strong> (the price of a car you have your eye on, minus the down payment you plan to pay). Next, set the payment to <strong>monthly</strong> and plug in the <strong>interest rate</strong> you expect. Can you swing those payments? Keep in mind, your monthly rate will vary depending on your <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-credit-score">credit score</a> and other factors.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352259">Loan Terms and Monthly Costs</h2>  <p data-seq="9">Auto loans are a type of installment loan. That means you borrow a set amount of money and make regular payments until you pay off the total. Most often, a car loan is paid over 36 to 72 months. The longer plans mean less cash outlay per month, but higher interest costs. Try to take the shortest loan that fits your budget to reduce interest.</p> <p data-seq="10">The average length is now 72 months, according to Edmunds.com, but they recommend 60 months if you can swing it. The average monthly loan payment for a new vehicle reached $648 in 2022, and the average for a used vehicle surpassed $500. Remember, that’s only the average. Some models have average monthly payments well under $500. Leasing is another option that may reduce monthly costs.</p>  <h2 id="toc-352260">Credit Score</h2>  <p data-seq="11">To some extent, your payment—and whether you get approved for a loan at all—reflects <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-credit-score">your credit score</a>. There’s no set minimum credit score to secure an auto loan, as each lender has their own criteria. However, you’ll generally get a better rate if your score is above 670.</p> <p data-seq="12">In a nutshell, your credit score reflects what kind of borrower you’ve been. It measures things like on-time payment history, any record of missed payments or foreclosures, and how much borrowing experience you have. A poor score can mean a bigger monthly payment. (You can <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/how-to-raise-your-credit-score">improve your credit score</a>, but it takes time and you might need a car sooner.)</p>  <h2 id="toc-352261">Determining Down Payment</h2>  <p data-seq="13">Now that you have a better sense of car loan costs, figure out how much you can afford to put down in cash. </p> <p data-seq="14">With car prices rising so much, most buyers can’t afford to reach the 20% down payment that conventional wisdom recommends. The average for new cars was about 13% in 2022, with used car down payments near 10% for those who opted for financing.</p> <p data-seq="15">With new cars costing an average of $47,000, you’d have to put down $6,110 to hit the average percentage on a new car. You’d only need $2,700 on the average used car price of $27,000. If cash is scarce, that can help you decide between new and used. </p> <p data-seq="16">It’s best to put down as much as you can. A higher down payment:</p> <ul><li>Can help you get a better rate, as lenders often grant lower rates to borrowers who pay more up front. </li><li>Reduces the monthly payment via lower interest costs.</li><li>Helps protect you from depreciation, which can quickly reduce a car’s value. Not putting down enough can mean going underwater on your loan (owing more than the car is worth).</li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-352262">Shopping for a Loan</h2>  <p data-seq="17">Once you’ve figured out the rate and down payment, start shopping for a loan. Begin by approaching your local bank or credit union. Many offer auto loans, and if it’s a bank where you’re already a customer, you may be able to score a lower-interest loan. They’ll also run a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/your-credit-report">credit report</a> to make sure you’ll be able to make your payments, in full and on time.</p> <p data-seq="18">Online lenders are another potential source. Some offer competitive rates and more convenience. Approach this carefully. Check with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Better Business Bureau to check whether a lender has a history of serious customer complaints. </p> <p data-seq="19">Applying for a car loan is similar to other loans. It means supplying some personal information (name, address, Social Security number) and your employment and income history.
