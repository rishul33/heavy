But when you buy shares, “market cap” isn’t just a ranking system for stocks. It’s like having a playbook that tells you how a stock might behave.</p> <p data-seq="2">An ocean freighter loaded with heavy cargo doesn’t zip through the waves like a speedboat on your local lake. Stocks also behave differently based on size. Traditionally, the biggest behemoths on Wall Street often cruise along more slowly and steadily, while the smallest companies are primed for speed and maneuverability. That’s why many analysts say you should consider a mix of different market caps in your portfolio for proper <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/portfolio-diversification-benefits">diversification.</a></p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Key Points</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><ul><li>Market capitalization is the number of outstanding shares of a company multiplied by its stock price.</li><li>Many major market indexes are organized by large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies.</li><li>Market cap can influence how a stock behaves and influence your investment strategy.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="3">You encounter market capitalization every time you check the major indexes. The <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average</strong> (DJIA) and<strong> S&amp;P 500</strong> (SPX), for example, are packed with some of the largest companies. The <strong>Russell 2000</strong> (RUT) tracks 2,000 “small-cap” companies.</p> <p data-seq="4">Some monster names on Wall Street, such as <strong>Apple</strong> (AAPL) and <strong>Microsoft</strong> (MSFT), have sometimes boasted market capitalizations of $2 trillion or more. But many stocks don’t even reach $1 billion on the market cap scale. That means the biggest stocks are worth more than 2,000 times the smallest, kind of like comparing the Queen Elizabeth luxury liner to a kayak.</p> <h2 id="toc-352151">How Market Cap Is Determined</h2>  <p data-seq="5">What is market capitalization, exactly? It’s calculated with simple multiplication:</p> <ul><li><strong>Stock price</strong> (X) multiplied by the <strong>number of shares outstanding</strong> (Y) = <strong>market capitalization</strong> (XY).</li></ul> <p data-seq="6">Companies issue shares, and the market decides every day at what price those shares should trade. The outcome is the total share value, or market cap, of the company. </p> <p data-seq="7"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-cryptocurrency">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</a> also can be valued by market cap. Here’s how crypto market cap is calculated:</p> <ul><li><strong>Current price</strong> (X) multiplied by the <strong>number of coins in circulation</strong> (Y) = <strong>market capitalization</strong> (XY)</li></ul>  <h2 id="toc-352152">Market Capitalization and Stock Indexes</h2>  <p data-seq="8">Stock indexes tend to focus on specific stock sizes, and the value of an index is often calculated based on company market caps. For instance, to be added to the S&amp;P 500, which covers approximately 80% of U.S. market capitalization, a stock must have a market cap of $14.6 billion or greater. That figure is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted. It also doesn’t apply to companies already in the index, so a company could potentially remain in the S&amp;P 500 if its cap falls below $14.6 billion.  </p> <p data-seq="9">The SPX is a “market-cap-weighted” index, meaning stocks with larger market caps have a bigger impact on the index’s performance. The idea behind cap-weighted index calculation is that the highest-valued stocks should have a bigger impact on index performance. So, a $2 trillion company has far more impact on S&amp;P 500 performance than, say, a $15 billion company.</p></div><div class="card CalloutCard_CalloutCard__z82ux my-20 font-sans-serif" data-testid="CalloutCard"><div class="card-body" data-testid="CardBody"><h2 class="font-16 font-weight-bold text-orange">Good to Know</h2><div class="Investing font-14"><p data-seq="10">At one point in 2021, five major technology companies (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet) made up nearly 23% of the S&amp;P 500’s value. The other 495 stocks, combined, accounted for the remaining 77%. So when the SPX makes, say, a 2% move, it’s important to check the top few stocks and see how they performed. That often tells most of the story. It also means there are days when hundreds of S&amp;P 500 stocks fall, but the index rises anyway.</p></div></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><p data-seq="11">The DJIA, on the other hand, is a “price-weighted” index of 30 large-cap U.S. stocks. The price-weighted nature of the index means price changes in its highest-priced stocks have a greater impact on the index level than price changes in the lower-priced stocks, regardless of company size. That makes it a bit of a relic and perhaps a less reliable indicator of overall market performance. Many market experts recommend following the SPX more closely for a quick snapshot of overall stock performance.</p> <p data-seq="12">FTSE Russell Indexes—a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group, which manages the RUT and several other indexes—performs an annual “reconstitution,” in part to determine where companies fit along the capitalization spectrum. This way, when investors buy an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/etfs-vs-mutual-funds">index fund </a>based on the Russell 2000, they can be sure no stocks in the fund have outgrown their small-cap status.</p> <h2 id="toc-352153">Notes on Market Cap Behavior</h2>  <p data-seq="13">Although there are no firm and fast rules for how a stock behaves based on market cap, there is some common wisdom in the markets about how large-caps tend to move relative to small-caps, based on outside factors such as recessions and the strength of the dollar. Here are a few to keep in mind:</p> <ul><li><strong>Dividends and growth stocks.</strong> Until recently, many investors saw large-cap stocks as steady performers that typically paid dividends, delivered predictable earnings, and were viewed as “cash cows” rather than high-growth flyers. That changed with companies like Apple and Microsoft, which continue to post huge growth numbers many decades after becoming publicly held companies. Plus, they <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-stock-dividend">pay dividends</a>. </li><li><strong>Old-line large-caps.</strong> Investors seeking dividend income and slow but steady earnings still often choose large-cap stocks that have been around for decades. Many of the big industrial, materials, and consumer staples companies fit into this category. Think <strong>Caterpillar</strong> (CAT), <strong>Dow</strong> (DOW), and <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (KO), for example. </li><li><strong>Small-caps and the domestic economy.</strong> Small-caps, and to some extent mid-caps, tend to do more of their business domestically, meaning they often perform best when the U.S. economy accelerates. When the U.S. economy flags, small-cap companies, with their heavier domestic exposure, can sometimes be the first stocks to lose ground. Sometimes their revival can signal the final stage of a recession. </li><li><strong>The U.S. dollar.</strong> Large-cap companies often do a heavier percentage of their business overseas. They may benefit when the dollar is weak, because a weak dollar tends to give overseas economies a boost. A strong dollar, on the other hand, makes products of large, multinational companies more expensive to overseas customers and can weigh on large-cap earnings. </li></ul> <p data-seq="14">When the dollar is strong, small-cap companies sometimes benefit from their domestic exposure.
