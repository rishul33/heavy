An adjustable rate mortgage, or ARM, comes with an interest rate that will change periodically based on an interest rate index. A fixed-rate mortgage, on the other hand, keeps the same interest rate throughout the entire term of the loan.</p> <p data-seq="5">People who choose an ARM typically do so because it comes with an attractive introductory interest rate. How long that rate lasts will be spelled out in your loan documents, and sometimes in the shorthand description of the loan. For example, a 5/1 ARM will keep its original rate for five years, and then readjust every year after that.</p> <p data-seq="6">The risk is that you could end up with much higher monthly payments on your loan than you expected. However, many ARMs have limits on how much they can raise their rates, called initial adjustment caps and interest caps. These terms are worth reviewing if you’re considering an ARM.    </p> <p data-seq="7">The majority of home buyers—80% to 90%—choose fixed-rate mortgages. With a fixed-rate mortgage, you know what your monthly payments will be for the life of the loan.</p> <p data-seq="8">If you plan to be in your home for a shorter term—say, five years or less—but you still prefer to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/buying-a-house-vs-renting">own rather than rent</a>, an ARM might be your best bet.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351994">30-Year, 15-Year, and 10-Year Fixed Mortgages</h2>  <p data-seq="9">How long do you want to be paying off your mortgage? The loan term you choose will depend on how much money you can budget for loan repayment each month. </p> <p data-seq="10">There are a few advantages to taking a shorter-term mortgage. For starters, you’ll pay it off and own your home sooner. And most of the time (but not always) you’ll be offered a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-the-yield-curve">lower interest rate than you would on a longer-term loan</a>.</p> <p data-seq="11">As anyone who’s paid off a mortgage will tell you, it’s an amazing feeling to be unencumbered by that monthly payment. Sure, you’ll still be on the hook for property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities, but the monthly mortgage payment is frequently the biggest line item on a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/setting-monthly-budget">monthly budget</a>, so paying it off can open up a lot of budgeting flexibility.</p> <p data-seq="12">A longer-term loan, on the other hand, not only comes with a higher interest rate, but also more payments, meaning you’ll pay more overall for your home—much of it in interest. But because your principal payments are spread over 30 years, the overall monthly payment is lower. That allows for its own level of budget flexibility.</p>  <h2 id="toc-351995">Calculating Your Mortgage Payments</h2>  <p data-seq="13">How much you can afford to borrow for a home depends on your budget. Consider your household finances now and in the future to help you make the right decision about the type of home you want to buy, and how to pay for it.</p> <p data-seq="14">One place to start is with a mortgage calculator (see the “Loan Calculator” below). How much home can you afford? To get a starting point, put in the <strong>amount of your loan</strong> (the price of a house you have your eye on, minus the down payment you plan to put down). Next, select your <strong>mortgage term</strong> and the published <strong>interest rate</strong> for that mortgage type, and set the payment to <strong>monthly</strong>. Do you like what you see? Keep in mind, your rate will vary depending on your credit score, whether you’ll need mortgage insurance, and other factors.</p></div><div class="Calculator_Calculator__Cvttx gigacalculator float-sm-right" data-tool="/calculators/loan-calculator.php" data-testid="Calculator"><div class="gigacalctitle text-capitalize">loan calculator</div><div class="gigacalcfooter"><a class="text-capitalize" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/loan-calculator.php">loan calculator</a> <!-- -->by<!-- --> <a class="gigacalclink" href="https://www.gigacalculator.com/">GIGAcalculator.com</a></div></div><div class="HTMLContent_HTMLContent__ieTLh" data-testid="HTMLContent"><h2 id="toc-351996">Other Types of Mortgages</h2>  <p data-seq="16">Although the vast majority of your mortgage questions may revolve around the rate and the term, there are other, more exotic mortgage options out there. Depending on your personal situation, one or more of them might be worth a look:</p> <ul><li><strong>Balloon mortgage.</strong> This loan is structured with lower monthly payments until the very end of the mortgage term, when you’ll be required to pay off the balance in one giant payment—at least twice the monthly payment, and usually many times that amount. At that point, you’ll be faced with a big decision and a big risk: You can pay off the balance, take out a new loan at the prevailing rate, or sell the home. With a balloon mortgage, you’ll have to ask yourself whether those lower payments are worth the risk.  </li><li><strong>Jumbo mortgage.</strong> This is for mortgage balances above the “conforming mortgage” limits set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). For 2022, the conforming ceiling is $647,200 in most places, and $970,800 in areas deemed “high cost.” Jumbo mortgages used to come with much higher rates than conforming loans, but that’s no longer the case. In fact, because many jumbo mortgage borrowers have high credit scores, the rate difference is often negligible. </li><li><strong>Piggyback mortgage.</strong> This is when you take out two loans: a mortgage and a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. The mortgage is to pay for the home, and the second loan is to help you make a 20% down payment on that home. By having that 20% down payment, you can avoid the cost of mortgage insurance. </li><li><strong>Interest-only mortgage.</strong> This type of mortgage—as the name implies—requires you to pay only the interest portion of a conventional mortgage, which means you’re not paying down the principal balance. Interest-only mortgages came under fire in the wake of the 2008–09 financial crisis for exacerbating the severity of the housing market meltdown. They’re not nearly as popular nowadays.
