In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

The idea reportedly occurred to him after his daughter Jenny accidentally knocked over the family’s spinning wheel; the spindle continued to turn even as the machine lay on the floor, suggesting to Hargreaves that a single wheel could turn several spindles at once. He obtained a patent for the spinning jenny in 1770.</p><!--[P2]--><!--[AM2]--><span class="AM2 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD2]--><span class="MOD2"></span><!--[BP3]--><p class="topic-paragraph"><strong>The water frame.</strong> So called because it was powered by a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/waterwheel-engineering" class="md-crosslink">waterwheel</a>, the water frame, patented in 1769 by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Arkwright" class="md-crosslink">Richard Arkwright</a>, was the first fully automatic and continuously operating spinning machine. It produced stronger and greater quantities of thread than the spinning jenny did. Because of its size and power source, the water frame could not be housed in the homes of spinners, as earlier machines had been. Instead, it required a location in a large building near a fast-running stream. Arkwright and his partners built several such factories in the mountainous areas of Britain. Spinners, including child laborers, thereafter worked in ever-larger factories rather than in their homes.</p><!--[P3]--><!--[AM3]--><span class="AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="MOD3"></span><!--[BP4]--><p class="topic-paragraph"><strong>The spinning mule.</strong> About 1779 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-Crompton" class="md-crosslink">Samuel Crompton</a> invented the spinning mule, which he designed by combining features of the spinning jenny and the water frame. His machine was capable of producing fine as well as coarse yarn and made it possible for a single operator to work more than 1,000 spindles simultaneously. Unfortunately, Crompton, being poor, lacked the money to patent his idea. He was cheated out of his invention by a group of manufacturers who paid him much less than they had promised for the design. The spinning mule was eventually used in hundreds of factories throughout the British textile industry.</p><!--[P4]--><!--[AM4]--><span class="AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="MOD4"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-1]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-1"></span></li><li><h2> The steam engine</h2><div><!--[BP5]--><p class="topic-paragraph">Through its application in manufacturing and as a power source in ships and railway locomotives, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/steam-engine" class="md-crosslink">steam engine</a> increased the productive capacity of factories and led to the great expansion of national and international transportation networks in the 19th century.</p><!--[P5]--><!--[AM5]--><span class="AM5 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD5]--><span class="MOD5"></span><!--[BP6]--><p class="topic-paragraph"><strong>Watt’s steam engine.</strong> In Britain in the 17th century, primitive steam engines were used to pump water out of mines. In 1765 Scottish inventor <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Watt" class="md-crosslink">James Watt</a>, building on earlier improvements, increased the efficiency of steam pumping engines by adding a separate condenser, and in 1781 he designed a machine to rotate a shaft rather than generate the up-and-down motion of a pump. With further improvements in the 1780s, Watt’s engine became a primary power source in paper mills, flour mills, cotton mills, iron mills, distilleries, canals, and waterworks, making Watt a wealthy man.</p><!--[P6]--><!--[AM6]--><span class="AM6 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD6]--><span class="MOD6"></span><!--[BP7]--><p class="topic-paragraph"><strong>The steam locomotive.</strong> British engineer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Trevithick" class="md-crosslink">Richard Trevithick</a> is generally recognized as the inventor of the steam railway locomotive (1803), an application of the steam engine that Watt himself had once dismissed as impractical. Trevithick also adapted his engine to propel a barge by turning paddle wheels and to operate a dredger. Trevithick’s engine, which generated greater power than Watt’s by operating at higher pressures, soon became common in industrial applications in Britain, displacing Watt’s less-efficient design. The first steam-powered locomotive to carry paying passengers was the <em>Active</em> (later renamed the <em>Locomotion</em>), designed by English engineer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Stephenson" class="md-crosslink">George Stephenson</a>, which made its maiden run in 1825. For a new passenger railroad line between Liverpool and Manchester, completed in 1830, Stephenson and his son designed the <em>Rocket</em>, which achieved a speed of 36 miles (58 km) per hour. </p><!--[P7]--><!--[AM7]--><span class="AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="MOD7"></span><!--[BP8]--><p class="topic-paragraph"><strong>Steamboats and steamships.</strong> Steamboats and other steamships were pioneered in France, Britain, and the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The first commercially successful paddle steamer, the <em>North River Steamboat</em>, designed by American engineer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Fulton-American-inventor" class="md-crosslink">Robert Fulton</a>, traveled up the Hudson River from New York City to Albany, New York, in 1807 at a speed of about 5 miles (8 km) per hour. Eventually, ever larger steamboats delivered cargo as well as passengers over hundreds of miles of inland waterways of the eastern and central United States, especially the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mississippi-River" class="md-crosslink">Mississippi River</a>. The first transoceanic voyage to employ steam power was completed in 1819 by the <em>Savannah</em>, an American sailing ship with an auxiliary steam-powered paddle. It sailed from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool in a little more than 27 days, though its paddle operated for only 85 hours of the voyage. By the second half of the 19th century, ever larger and faster steamships were regularly carrying passengers, cargo, and mail across the North Atlantic, a service dubbed “the Atlantic Ferry.”</p><!--[P8]--><!--[AM8]--><span class="AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="MOD8"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-2]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-2"></span></li><li><h2> Harnessing electricity</h2><div><!--[BP9]--><p class="topic-paragraph">In the early 19th century, scientists in Europe and the United States explored the relationship between electricity and magnetism, and their research soon led to practical applications of electromagnetic phenomena. </p><!--[P9]--><!--[AM9]--><span class="AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="MOD9"></span><!--[BP10]--><p class="topic-paragraph"><strong>Electric generators and electric motors.</strong> In the 1820s and ’30s British scientist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Faraday" class="md-crosslink">Michael Faraday</a> demonstrated experimentally that passing an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/electric-current" class="md-crosslink">electric current</a> through a coil of wire between two poles of a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/magnet" class="md-crosslink">magnet</a> would cause the coil to turn, while turning a coil of wire between two poles of a magnet would generate an electric current in the coil (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Faradays-law-of-induction" class="md-crosslink">electromagnetic induction</a>).

American artist and inventor <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-F-B-Morse" class="md-crosslink">Samuel F.B. Morse</a> created his own electric telegraph and, more famously, a universal code, since known as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Morse-Code" class="md-crosslink">Morse Code</a>, that could be used in any system of telegraphy. The code, consisting of a set of symbolic dots, dashes, and spaces, was soon adopted (in modified form to accommodate diacritics) throughout the world. A demonstration telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, was completed in 1844. The first message sent on it was, “What hath God wrought!” Telegraph cables were first laid across the English Channel in 1851 and across the Atlantic Ocean in 1858. In the United States the spread of telegraphic communication through the growth of private telegraph companies such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-Union-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">Western Union</a> aided the maintenance of law and order in the Western territories and the control of traffic on the railroads.

Bell’s device consisted of two sets of metallic reeds (membranes) and electromagnetic coils. Sound waves produced near one membrane caused it to vibrate at certain frequencies, which induced corresponding currents in the electromagnetic coil connected to it, and those currents then flowed to the other coil, which in turn caused the other membrane to vibrate at the same frequencies, reproducing the original sound waves. The first “telephone call” (successful electric transmission of intelligible human speech) took place between two rooms of Bell’s Boston laboratory on March 10, 1876, when Bell summoned his assistant, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Augustus-Watson" class="md-crosslink">Thomas Watson</a>, with the famous words that Bell transcribed in his notes as “Mr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you.” Initially the telephone was a curiosity or a toy for the rich, but by the mid-20th century it had become a common household instrument, billions of which were in use throughout the world.</p><!--[P15]--><!--[AM15]--><span class="AM15 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD15]--><span class="MOD15"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-4]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-4"></span></li><li><h2> The internal-combustion engine and the automobile</h2><div><!--[BP16]--><p class="topic-paragraph">Among the most-consequential inventions of the late Industrial Revolution were the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/internal-combustion-engine" class="md-crosslink">internal-combustion engine</a> and, along with it, the gasoline-powered <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/automobile" class="md-crosslink">automobile</a>.
