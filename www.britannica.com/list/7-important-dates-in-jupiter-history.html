In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being. Research on potential treatments and preventive medicine has expanded greatly with the development of modern medicine, and a network of disciplines, including such fields as genetics, psychology, and nutrition, aims to facilitate the betterment of our health.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg","altText":"Health & Medicine","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg"}},{"id":8000,"title":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","urlTitle":"Lifestyles-Social-Issues","description":"It's easy enough to agree that human beings all around the world have certain basic requirements that must be fulfilled in order to ensure their individual and collective well-being. History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word. A literary work can transport us into a fictional, fantastic new world, describe a fleeting feeling, or simply give us a picture of the past through novels, poems, tragedies, epic works, and other genres. Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too. Thanks to human curiosity and technological research, many significant inventions have been made throughout history that in turn made a difference in our daily lives.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg","altText":"Technology","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg"}},{"id":11000,"title":"Visual Arts","urlTitle":"Visual-Arts","description":"These are the arts that meet the eye and evoke an emotion through an expression of skill and imagination. They include the most ancient forms, such as painting and drawing, and the arts that were born thanks to the development of technology, like sculpture, printmaking, photography, and installation art. Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, different eras in art history have had their own principles to define beauty, from the richly ornamented taste of the Baroque to the simple utilitarian style of the Prairie School.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg","altText":"Visual Arts","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg"}},{"id":6000,"title":"World History","urlTitle":"World-History","description":"Does history really repeat itself, or can we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us?

So what event in early Jupiter history could possibly compare? Only the discovery that helped prove that Earth is not the center of the universe. On January 7, 1610, astronomer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galileo-Galilei" class="md-crosslink">Galileo Galilei</a> used a telescope to observe Jupiter and found peculiar fixated stars surrounding the planet. He recorded the movements of these four stars for the next few days, discovering that they moved with Jupiter and changed their location around the planet each night. Having just studied Earth’s moon with his telescope, Galileo had seen movement like this before—those “stars,” he realized, were not stars at all but individual moons that seemed to revolve around Jupiter. Galileo’s discovery debunked the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ptolemaic-system" class="md-crosslink">Ptolemaic system</a> of astronomy, which assumed Earth as the center of the solar system with all other celestial bodies revolving around it. By observing four of Jupiter’s moons (later named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), Galileo provided strong evidence for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system" class="md-crosslink">Copernican model</a> of the solar system, which places the Sun at the center of the solar system with Earth and the other planets moving around it and smaller celestial bodies like moons revolving around the planets.</p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-1]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-1"></span></li><li><h2>August 22, 1676: Rømer Waits for the Speed of Light</h2><div><figure class="md-assembly md-feature-assembly print-false"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper card-media" data-type="image"><a style="" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/10/21210-004-88115DFC/Io-Jupiter-background-spacecraft-contrast-Voyager-1-March-2-1979.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link" data-href="*17707"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/10/21210-004-88115DFC/Io-Jupiter-background-spacecraft-contrast-Voyager-1-March-2-1979.jpg?q=60" alt="Io, one of Jupiter&amp;#39;s satellites, with Jupiter in the background.

Rømer spent time observing the movement of Io and Jupiter’s other satellites and compiling timetables of their orbital periods (the time it takes for the moons to revolve around Jupiter once). Io’s orbital period was observed to be 1.769 Earth days. Rømer was so dedicated in his studies that he continued tracking and timing Io’s orbital period for years, discovering a very interesting phenomenon as a result. Because Rømer was observing Io’s orbit throughout the year, he was recording data as Earth and Jupiter moved farther apart and closer to each other as they themselves orbited the Sun. What he discovered was a 17-minute delay in a usually clockwork eclipse of Io that occurred when Earth and Jupiter were farther away from each other. Rømer knew that Io’s orbital period couldn’t be changing just because of the distance between Earth and Jupiter, so he developed a theory: if only the distance between the planets was changing, the image of Io’s eclipse must be taking those 17 extra minutes to reach our eyes on Earth. This theory of Rømer’s was rooted in another: that light moved at a fixed speed. Rømer was able to use rough calculations of Earth’s diameter and the time delay from Jupiter to come up with a speed of light that was fairly close to the actual adopted value.</p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-2]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-2"></span></li><li><h2>1831: Seeing (Giant Red) Spots</h2><div><figure class="md-assembly md-feature-assembly print-false"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper card-media" data-type="image"><a style="" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/58/21158-050-238ED4DD/Jupiter-Great-Red-Spot-surroundings-Voyager-1-February-25-1979.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link" data-href="*69388"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/58/21158-050-238ED4DD/Jupiter-Great-Red-Spot-surroundings-Voyager-1-February-25-1979.jpg?q=60" alt="Jupiter&amp;#39;s Great Red Spot and its surroundings.

The first record of its being observed comes from an astronomer named Samuel Heinrich Schwabe in 1831. Though some “spots” on Jupiter had been observed by astronomers in earlier years, Schwabe was the first to depict the spot with its characteristic redness. The storm itself rotates counterclockwise and takes about six or seven days to completely travel around the entire planet. The size of the storm has changed since its discovery, becoming bigger and smaller as conditions within the planet change. It was believed to be about 49,000 km (30,000 miles) wide in the late 19th century but has since been shrinking at a rate of about 900 km (580 miles) per year. Eventually, it seems, the Great Red Spot will be gone. Though it is impossible to know for sure what the contents of the storm are, its characteristic redness could mean that it is filled with sulfur or phosphorous materials. It is most notable when it is red, but the spot actually changes color as the storm’s composition changes.</p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-3]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-3"></span></li><li><h2>April 6, 1955: 95.5 Radio Jupiter</h2><div><figure class="md-assembly md-feature-assembly print-false"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper card-media" data-type="image"><a style="" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/22/77722-050-08D2A567/Jupiter-Image-radiation-belts-radio-emission-planet-January-2001.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link" data-href="*73206"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/22/77722-050-08D2A567/Jupiter-Image-radiation-belts-radio-emission-planet-January-2001.jpg?q=60" alt="Synchrotron emission around Jupiter, observed by the Cassini orbiter." data-width="1438" data-height="644" loading="lazy"></a></div><figcaption class=""><a class="md-assembly-title font-weight-bold mb-5 d-inline-block font-16 font-sans-serif media-overlay-link" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/22/77722-050-08D2A567/Jupiter-Image-radiation-belts-radio-emission-planet-January-2001.jpg" data-href="*73206">Jupiter: radiation belts</a><cite class="credit d-block mt-5">NASA/JPL</cite></figcaption></figure><!--[BP1]--><p class="topic-paragraph">In 1955 two astronomers, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin, set up a radio astronomy array in a field just outside Washington, D.C., to record data on celestial bodies in the sky that produce radio waves. After collecting a few weeks of data, the two scientists observed something strange in their results. About the same time every night there was an anomaly—a spike in radio transmission. Burke and Franklin at first believed this could be some sort of earthly interference. But after mapping where their radio astronomy array was pointed at this time, they noticed that it was Jupiter that seemed to be transmitting radio signals. The two researchers searched previous data for any sign that this could be true, that Jupiter could have been transmitting these strong radio signals without anyone noticing, and they uncovered over 5 years of data that supported their findings. The discovery that Jupiter transmitted bursts of radio signals allowed Burke and Franklin to use their data, which seemed to match patterns in Jupiter’s rotation, to more precisely calculate how long it takes Jupiter to revolve around its axis. The result? A single day on Jupiter was calculated to last only about 10 hours.</p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-4]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-4"></span></li><li><h2>March 5, 1977: Ring Around the Jupiter</h2><div><figure class="md-assembly md-feature-assembly print-false"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper card-media" data-type="image"><a style="" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/33/21233-050-5286FDFA/ring-system-Jupiter-moons-illustration-rings-micrometeroids.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link" data-href="*211795"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/33/21233-050-5286FDFA/ring-system-Jupiter-moons-illustration-rings-micrometeroids.jpg?q=60" alt="Jupiter&amp;#39;s ring.The drawing shows the four minor satellites that provide the ring&amp;#39;s dust, as well as the main ring, surrounding gossamer rings, and halo.

The photographs and other data that the two Voyager probes collected provided new insights into the planet’s features. The biggest finding was confirmation of Jupiter’s ring system, an arrangement of clouds of solid matter that circle the planet. Dust and remains from collisions that occur on Jupiter’s moons are the main components of the rings. The moons Adrastea and Metis are the sources for the main ring, and the moons Amalthea and Thebe are the sources of the outer part of the rings, called the gossamer rings. The photographs taken by the Voyager 1 and 2 probes also showed an active volcano on the surface of the Jovian moon Io. This was the first active volcano to be found outside Earth. Io’s volcanoes were discovered to be the top producers of matter found in Jupiter’s magnetosphere—a region around the planet where electrically charged objects are controlled by the planet’s magnetic field. This observation showed that Io has a larger effect on Jupiter and its surrounding satellites than previously thought.</p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-5]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-5"></span></li><li><h2>December 7, 1995: Galileo Returns from the Grave</h2><div><figure class="md-assembly md-feature-assembly print-false"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper card-media" data-type="image"><a style="" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/45/65045-004-8F64C6B1/spacecraft-orbit-Galileo-booster-artist-rendering-space-December-1995.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link" data-href="*53280"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/45/65045-004-8F64C6B1/spacecraft-orbit-Galileo-booster-artist-rendering-space-December-1995.jpg?q=60" alt="The Galileo spacecraft and its upper stage separate from the Earth-orbiting space shuttle Atlantis.

The orbiter and its probe were on a mission to study Jupiter’s atmosphere and learn more about its Galilean moons—the first four of Jupiter’s moons that were discovered, by Galileo. The probe expanded on findings from the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which had discovered the moon Io’s volcanic activity, and showed not only that these volcanoes exist but that their activity is much stronger than the volcanic activity currently seen on Earth. Rather, Io’s volcanic activity is similar in strength to that at the beginning of Earth’s existence. The Galileo probe also discovered evidence of salt water below the surface of the moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto as well as the presence of a type of atmosphere surrounding these three moons. The major discovery on Jupiter itself was of the presence of ammonia clouds in the planet’s atmosphere. Galileo’s mission ended in 2003, and it was sent on another—a suicide mission. The spacecraft was plunged into the atmosphere of Jupiter to stop it from contaminating with bacteria from Earth the Jovian moons and their possible life-forms living in the possible underground salt water. </p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-6]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-6"></span></li><li><h2>July 4, 2016: Juno and Beyond</h2><div><figure class="md-assembly md-feature-assembly print-false"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper card-media" data-type="image"><a style="" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/83/143283-050-3090E58F/Artist-conception-spacecraft-Juno-Jupiter.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link" data-href="*147316"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/83/143283-050-3090E58F/Artist-conception-spacecraft-Juno-Jupiter.jpg?q=60" alt="Launching from Earth in 2011, the Juno spacecraft will arrive at Jupiter in 2016 to study the giant planet from an elliptical, polar orbit.

While it’s too early in its orbital period and too far away from Jupiter to measure data from the planet’s atmosphere (as of the writing of this list), Juno will likely supply some of the most-revealing data regarding the makeup of Jupiter and its outer atmosphere. The probe will eventually reach a polar orbit that will allow it to assess the levels of water, oxygen, ammonia, and other substances within the planet’s atmosphere and give clues to the planet’s formation. A look deeper into the storms that circle around Jupiter, such as its Great Red Spot, will also be possible with infrared technology and measurements of the planet’s gravity. The number one hope is that Juno will allow astronomers to piece together Jupiter’s origin story in order to learn more about the development of not only the planet but the rest of our solar system as well. Much like the Galileo spacecraft, the Juno probe is scheduled to destroy itself on February 20, 2018, by hurtling into Jupiter in order to avoid contaminating the planet’s moons. </p><!--[P1]--><!--[AM1]--><span class="AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="MOD1"></span></div><!--[LIST-ITEM-7]--><span class="LIST-ITEM-7"></span></li></ul></article>
