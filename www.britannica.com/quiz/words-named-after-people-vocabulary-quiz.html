(A rampion, <i>Campanula rapunculus</i>, is similar to a turnip.) During his second theft he is caught, and the enchantress makes a deal: she will let him take as many rampions as the wife craves in exchange for the child his wife will give birth to. Scared, he agrees. After the child is born, the enchantress names her Rapunzel, another name for the vegetable that caused the whole ordeal, and takes her away.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">radish</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">rutabaga</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">rapini</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In “The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids,” six young goats are eaten by the big bad villain.

In a fit of grief she leaves her home, and on her walk she finds the wolf asleep under a tree. She sees something wriggling in his belly and cuts him open, freeing her children. She then replaces them with stones, which makes him extremely heavy and causes him to drown when he attempts to drink from a well.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">The mother goat dies of anguish, and the wolf eats her too.</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">A hunter continuously kicks the wolf, causing it to throw up each kid.</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">The wolf becomes remorseful and cuts his stomach open.</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What are Ashputtel’s slippers for the third night made of in the Grimms’ telling of the Cinderella folktale?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">gold</answer> <explanation>In order to get her dress and slippers, Ashputtel—which is the Grimms’ name for their version of <link id=\"118017\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/topic/Cinderella-folktale-heroine\">Cinderella</link>—says in her garden, “Shake, shake, hazel-tree, / Gold and silver over me!” On the third day of her saying this, doves bring her a dress finer than her last and slippers made of gold. It is one of these slippers that she loses on the stairs in her hasty retreat from the ball.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">glass</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">leather</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">diamond</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Which of these is <i>not</i> a title of one of the Grimms’ fairy tales?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">“Jack and the Beanstalk”</answer> <explanation><i><link id=\"246241\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/topic/Grimms-Fairy-Tales\">Grimm’s Fairy Tales</link></i> compromises some 200 stories, most of which were adopted from oral stories, but “Jack and the Beanstalk” comes from a different book of fairy tales, written by <link id=\"299078\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Joseph-Jacobs\">Joseph Jacobs</link>.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">“The Pink”</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">“The Four Clever Brothers”</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">“Doctor Knowall”</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>True or False: At the end of “Little Red-Cap”—better known as “Little Red Riding Hood”—the main character meets another wolf and doesn’t speak to this one, but she and her grandmother cook up a way to kill it.</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">true</answer> <explanation>At the end of the Grimms’ tale about Little Red Riding Hood, she tells her grandmother about this wolf’s wicked intentions instead of letting another wolf trick her.

Cats and mice are natural enemies and can never truly be “partners,” which is why the tale’s omniscient narrator is not surprised that the cat ate his mouse partner.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">“And the cat lived happily ever after.”</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">“Cats and mice should always be partners.”</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">“Cats should never be trusted.”</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In “The Frog-Prince,” what does the princess do to the frog instead of kissing him?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">throws him against a wall</answer> <explanation>In the Grimms’ “The Frog-Prince” the princess makes a deal with the frog whereby she is to love him and accept him as a companion and playmate in exchange for him retrieving a ball that had fallen into a well. She doesn’t keep her promise, however, because she is disgusted by the frog. The frog follows her back to the palace where the king tells her to keep her promise, which includes letting him live with her, eat from her golden plate, and sleep in her bed. Angry that she is being forced to become companions with the frog, she throws him against the wall, hoping he will die. Instead, he returns to his princely form.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">steps on him</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">eats his legs in a soup</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">returns him to the pond where she found him</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In the Grimms’ “Little Snow White,” which parts of Snow White does the evil queen express a desire to eat?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">lungs and liver</answer> <explanation>The queen becomes jealous that Snow White is fairer than her, according to the Grimms’ “Snow White,” so the queen orders a huntsman to kill Snow White.

After the prince then once again climbs the long locks, he leaps from the tower in misery, believing Rapunzel to be gone forever. He lands in bushes that blind him. Wandering for years, the prince comes across the desert where Rapunzel is exiled. Upon realizing they have found each other again, they embrace, and Rapunzel’s tears, dripping onto his face, cure him of his blindness.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">his true-love’s kiss</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">rampion leaves</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Nothing.

At the wedding the prince puts a golden necklace around Maid Maleen’s neck as proof of their marriage. When the prince goes to their wedding chambers and sees the princess there without the golden necklace, he realizes that he married someone other than his actual betrothed.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Her hair color was one shade off.</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Her fingers were dry and wrinkly.</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Her bridal shoes were too small.</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What did Ashputtel’s mother make her promise to be before she died?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">good</answer> <explanation>After falling deathly ill, the mother of Ashputtel (the Grimms’ version of <link id=\"118017\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/topic/Cinderella-folktale-heroine\">Cinderella</link>) tells her daughter to remain good and that she will always watch over her. Her mother then dies. While visiting her mother’s grave, Ashputtel plants a twig that was gifted to her by her father and waters it three times a day with her tears until it becomes a beautiful tree.

In order to get rid of the nagging flies, he grabs a ragged cloth and swipes at the flies, killing seven at once. To celebrate his feat, he cuts out a belt and stitches on it “Seven at one blow!”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">He sewed seven dresses in one sitting.</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">He killed seven men with one fist.</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">He blew out seven large candles with one breath.</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>    <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Why does Rumpelstiltskin want the queen’s child?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">He knows that her unborn child would become her most valued possession.</answer> <explanation>In the Grimms’ “Rumpelstiltskin,” the queen, after forgetting her promise to Rumpelstiltskin to give him her firstborn in order for him to help her spin gold, offers him all the riches the kingdom has to offer. He refuses because her child is more important to the queen—and, consequently, him—than all the riches of the land.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">to eat as a meal</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">A spell requires a live sacrifice.</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">to get revenge on the king who wronged him</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What is the queen’s punishment for her attempts to have Snow White killed?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">dancing to death in red-hot iron shoes</answer> <explanation>In the Grimms’ “Little Snow White,” Snow White’s stepmother is invited to the prince’s wedding after believing she has successfully killed Snow White. The mirror on the wall tells her that the young queen is fairer than her, and so she goes to the feast in order to see who this woman is. Recognizing the young queen as Snow White, she is paralyzed with fear; she is then punished by having red-hot iron shoes placed on her feet, which forces her to dance until she falls down dead.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">renouncing her royalty</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">becoming old and ugly</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">eating poison apples for eternity</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What does Hansel stuff into his pockets after he learns that he and Gretel are to be abandoned in the forest?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">pebbles</answer> <explanation>In the Grimms’ “Hansel and Gretel,” the title characters’ family is very poor, with too many mouths to feed. Their stepmother persuades her husband to lead Hansel and Gretel into the forest and abandon them there so they will no longer have to be fed. However, Hansel and Gretel overhear this, and Hansel hatches a plan: he sneaks out at night, fills his coat with pebbles, and then goes to bed. While they are being taken out to the forest, Hansel drops pebbles along the way so that he and his sister can find their way back home.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">marbles</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">chalk</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">small crackers</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In which tale by the Grimms does a stepmother chop off the head of her stepson?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">“The Juniper-Tree”</answer> <explanation>In the Grimms’ “The Juniper-Tree” a wealthy and pious couple wishes every day for a child.

She has the child, a boy, but she dies not long after. Her husband remarries and has a daughter. The stepmother loves her daughter but despises her stepson and abuses him daily. In a fit of pure evil, as the young boy asks for an apple and heads to the chest to retrieve it, the stepmother closes the heavy lid on the boy’s head, decapitating him.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">“The Robber Bridegroom”</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">“Mother Holle”</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">“Briar Rose”</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  </questionList>  </quiz> </feature>","urlTitle":"grimms-fairy-tales-quiz","typeDisplayName":"Quiz","cssClassName":"QUIZ","mainCategory":{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word.

Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},null,null],"hashtags":["traditions","religion","traditions quiz","quiz","britannica","encyclopedia britannica","quizzes"],"hashtagsString":"traditions, religion, traditions quiz, quiz, britannica, encyclopedia britannica, quizzes","displayDate":[2012,8,10],"contentXml":"<feature id=\"4479\">\n  \n  <quiz level=\"1\" NumOfQuestions=\"7\" isGeneral=\"false\" isVocabulary=\"false\" isTightrope=\"false\" isPopular=\"false\"><timing timed=\"true\" seconds=\"10\"/>\n    \n    \n    <metaDescription>Take this religion quiz on encyclopedia britannica to test your knowledge on traditions and religions around the world.</metaDescription><browserTitle>World Religions and Traditions Quiz</browserTitle><questionList>\n        <qMultipleChoice level=\"3\">\n          <question>\n            <query>What holiday ends Ramadan?</query>\n          </question>\n          \n            <answer correct=\"true\">Eid al-Fitr</answer>\n            <explanation>Eid al-Fitr, the Feast of Fast-Breaking, marks the end of the month of Ramadan and the beginning of the month of Shawwal.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}}},{"id":5457,"title":"Hezbollah","url":"/quiz/hezbollah","description":"How much do you know about Hezbollah?

In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being. Research on potential treatments and preventive medicine has expanded greatly with the development of modern medicine, and a network of disciplines, including such fields as genetics, psychology, and nutrition, aims to facilitate the betterment of our health.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg","altText":"Health & Medicine","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg"}},{"id":8000,"title":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","urlTitle":"Lifestyles-Social-Issues","description":"It's easy enough to agree that human beings all around the world have certain basic requirements that must be fulfilled in order to ensure their individual and collective well-being. History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word. A literary work can transport us into a fictional, fantastic new world, describe a fleeting feeling, or simply give us a picture of the past through novels, poems, tragedies, epic works, and other genres. Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too. Thanks to human curiosity and technological research, many significant inventions have been made throughout history that in turn made a difference in our daily lives.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg","altText":"Technology","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg"}},{"id":11000,"title":"Visual Arts","urlTitle":"Visual-Arts","description":"These are the arts that meet the eye and evoke an emotion through an expression of skill and imagination. They include the most ancient forms, such as painting and drawing, and the arts that were born thanks to the development of technology, like sculpture, printmaking, photography, and installation art. Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, different eras in art history have had their own principles to define beauty, from the richly ornamented taste of the Baroque to the simple utilitarian style of the Prairie School.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg","altText":"Visual Arts","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg"}},{"id":6000,"title":"World History","urlTitle":"World-History","description":"Does history really repeat itself, or can we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us?
