In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word. A literary work can transport us into a fictional, fantastic new world, describe a fleeting feeling, or simply give us a picture of the past through novels, poems, tragedies, epic works, and other genres. Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

	        <h1>Classic Children’s Books Quiz</h1>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: An editor told Shel Silverstein what book was “too simple” for adults and “too sad” for kids?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Shel Silverstein said he avoided happy endings because he didn’t want young readers to wonder why they weren’t as happy as those in his books. <em>The Giving Tree</em> has sold more than 10 million copies.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: In 1987 nine animal statues—a mama and eight babies—were erected in Boston to commemorate what book?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <em>Make Way for Ducklings</em> is the tale of Mrs. Mallard and her eight children navigating the streets of Boston. Sculptor Nancy Schön was asked to create a tribute to them in Boston Public Gardens. Her nine duck statues stretch out for a total of 35 feet.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which author originally wanted his 1963 picture book to be about “wild horses,” until he realized he couldn’t draw horses?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Maurice Sendak landed a contract to write a book he titled <em>Where the Wild Horses Are</em>. However, he realized he couldn’t draw horses very well, so he decided to switch to the more ambiguous <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>. He based his drawings of the “things” on childhood memories of unkempt relatives.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: According to <em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em>, what will the mouse ask for once he has a cookie?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Milk is needed to wash down the cookie, but then the mouse needs a straw to drink the milk, followed by a napkin to clean up and a mirror to check for a milk mustache. Eventually the list of desires grows to include another cookie, starting the cycle anew.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Eric Carle’s <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em> is known for what?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The book was published with holes cut through the pages, presumably eaten by the very hungry caterpillar.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which book was a result of a bet that Dr. Seuss couldn’t write a story with only 50 unique words?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Theodor Geisel was presented with a list of 348 teacher-approved words that help stimulate reading and was challenged to create a book kids couldn’t put down. Using only 236, he made <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. Later, Random House cofounder Bennett Cerf bet him $50 he couldn’t do it with just 50 words. After much agonizing, Seuss rose to the occasion by writing <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of the following books is about a stuffed bear who goes on an adventure in a department store?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: In Don Freeman’s book <em>Corduroy</em>, a small stuffed bear goes on the hunt for his missing button one night in the department store where he lives on a shelf. He hopes that fixing his overalls will make him more attractive to a potential buyer.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: In which book do we see “a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush”?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Author Margaret Wise Brown based <em>Goodnight Moon</em> on her childhood memories of saying goodnight to each object in the nursery she shared with her sister Roberta.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: The name Strega Nona comes from the Italian for what phrase?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Strega Nona is a wise old woman renowned for her magical powers, particularly her ever-filled pot of pasta. Author Tomie de Paola based the character in part on his own Italian American grandmother Concetta.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of these is widely considered the first picture book to star a Black child?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Author and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats had illustrated other people’s manuscripts and noticed none of them feature Black characters.&nbsp;Keats wrote about his character Peter, “My book would have him there simply because he should have been there all along.”</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: In the musical adaptation of which Roald Dahl book does the title character sing, “Sometimes you have to be a little bit naughty?”</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Matilda Wormwood has vile parents that she pulls tricks on (like supergluing a hat on her dad’s head) to teach them lessons. She gains the ability to manipulate objects with her mind, greatly enhancing her pranking potential. She uses her mischievous powers and supernatural ability to foil the evil headmistress Miss Trunchbull.</dd>
