The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},null,null],"hashtags":["britannica","encyclopedia britannica","quiz","quizzes","religion","islam","muslims","prophets","muhammad","mecca","ramadan","holidays","holy cities","quran","allah","shariah"],"hashtagsString":"britannica, encyclopedia britannica, quiz, quizzes, religion, islam, muslims, prophets, muhammad, mecca, ramadan, holidays, holy cities, quran, allah, shariah","displayDate":[2021,1,8],"contentXml":"<feature id=\"5185\">   <quiz level=\"3\" NumOfQuestions=\"57\" isGeneral=\"false\" isVocabulary=\"false\" isTightrope=\"false\" isPopular=\"true\"><timing timed=\"true\" seconds=\"10\"/>   <metaDescription>Take this Religion quiz at Encyclopedia Britannica to test your knowledge of Islam.</metaDescription><browserTitle>Islam Quiz</browserTitle><questionList> <qMultipleChoice level=\"2\"> <question> <query>Which of the following is <i>not</i> a source of Shari’ah (Islamic law)?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">fatwa</answer> <explanation>A fatwa is a decision issued by a judicial scholar.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Qur’an</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">sunnah</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">qiyas</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"> <question> <query>Which of the following is the largest Muslim country in the world by population?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Indonesia</answer> <explanation>Indonesia is the largest Muslim country by population.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Saudi Arabia</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Pakistan</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Iran</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Which of the following is the largest minority group in Islam?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Shi’a</answer> <explanation>The Shi’a (Shi’ites) constitute the largest minority group in Islam, at about ten percent of the world’s Muslim population.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Ahmadiyyah</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Wahhabiyyah</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Sufi</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"> <question> <query>Mecca is the holiest city in Islam and the focus of the pilgrimage, or hajj, that every Muslim strives to make at least once in life.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}}},{"id":5956,"title":"U.S. Presidential Elections Quiz","url":"/quiz/us-presidential-elections","description":"Which day of the week are U.S. presidential elections held?

Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.
