The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},null],"hashtags":["quiz","quizzes","Encyclopedia Britannica","Britannica","Christmas","Santa Claus","Christianity","holidays","celebrations","Jesus","Christmas Eve","December","A Visit from St. Nicholas","the Night Before Christmas","St. Nicholas","George Frideric Handel","Messiah","Magi","12 Days of Christmas","song","Christmas Island","Jultomte","Irving Berlin","Christmas card","paganism","festival","magi","candles","fir tree","Christmas tree","Puritans","England","Advent"],"hashtagsString":"quiz, quizzes, Encyclopedia Britannica, Britannica, Christmas, Santa Claus, Christianity, holidays, celebrations, Jesus, Christmas Eve, December, A Visit from St. Nicholas, the Night Before Christmas, St. Nicholas, George Frideric Handel, Messiah, Magi, 12 Days of Christmas, song, Christmas Island, Jultomte, Irving Berlin, Christmas card, paganism, festival, magi, candles, fir tree, Christmas tree, Puritans, England, Advent","displayDate":[2020,12,7],"contentXml":"<feature id=\"5372\">   <quiz level=\"4\" NumOfQuestions=\"15\" isGeneral=\"true\" isVocabulary=\"false\" isTightrope=\"false\" isPopular=\"false\"><timing timed=\"true\" seconds=\"30\"/>    <metaDescription>Take this Lifestyles and Social Issues quiz at Encyclopedia Britannica to test your knowledge about Christmas.</metaDescription><browserTitle>Everything You Need To Know About Christmas Quiz</browserTitle><questionList> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>When was December 25 first identified as the day when Jesus was born?

The term <i>knot</i> probably results from its former use as a length measure on ships’ log lines, which were used to measure the speed of a ship through the water. Such a line was marked off at intervals by knots tied in the rope. Each interval, or knot, was about 47 feet (14.3 metres) long. When the log was tossed overboard, it remained more or less stationary while its attached log line trailed out from the vessel as the latter moved forward. After 28 seconds had elapsed, the number of knots that had passed overboard was counted. The number of knots that ran out in 28 seconds was roughly the speed of the ship in nautical miles per hour.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">depth of a harbour</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">weight of an anchor</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">height of a mast</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What early vehicles were known as “boneshakers”?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">bicycles</answer> <explanation>The hard ride of wood-spoked wheels and iron rims gave early velocipedes the sobriquet of “boneshaker,” but solid rubber tires and wire-spoked wheels helped soften the ride.

Armstrong</link> secured four patents on advanced circuits that revealed an entirely new radio system, from transmitter to receiver. Instead of varying the amplitude, or power, of radio waves to carry voice or music, as in all radio before then, the new system varied, or modulated, the waves’ frequency (number of waves per second) over a wide band of frequencies. This created a carrier wave that natural static could not break into. As a result, the wide frequency range of <link id=\"219647\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/technology/frequency-modulation\">frequency modulation</link>, or FM, made possible the first clear, practical method of high-fidelity broadcasting.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">shortwave</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">amplitude modulation</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">microwave</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Binoculars are commonly designated as 6 x 30, 7 x 50, or 8 x 30.

What significant advance did the Audion immediately make possible?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">amplification of radio signals</answer> <explanation>The American inventor <link id=\"153484\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Lee-de-Forest\">Lee de Forest</link> in 1906 conceived the idea of interposing an open-meshed grid between a heated filament and positively biased anode, or plate, to control the flow of electrons. De Forest called his invention an <link id=\"42564\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/technology/Audion\">Audion</link>. With it he could obtain a large voltage change at the plate for a small voltage change on the grid electrode. This was a discovery of major importance because it made it possible to amplify the radio-frequency signal picked up by the antenna before application to the receiver detector; thus, much weaker signals could be utilized than had previously been possible.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">wireless telegraphs</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">television</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">microwave ovens</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In 1877 Thomas Alva Edison made indentations in a strip of coated paper with a stylus connected to a transmitter. When he pulled the strip back through the apparatus, he was astonished to hear that it produced a sound. What had he just invented?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">the phonograph</answer> <explanation>In 1877 <link id=\"179233\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Thomas-Edison\">Thomas Alva Edison</link> achieved his most original discovery, the <link id=\"457279\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/technology/phonograph\">phonograph</link>. Some earlier researchers had theorized that each sound, if it could be graphically recorded, would produce a distinct shape resembling shorthand, or phonography (“sound writing”), as it was then known. Edison hoped to reify this concept by employing a stylus-tipped carbon transmitter to make impressions on a strip of paraffined paper. To his astonishment, the scarcely visible indentations generated a vague reproduction of sound when the paper was pulled back beneath the stylus. Edison unveiled the tinfoil phonograph, which replaced the strip of paper with a cylinder wrapped in tinfoil, in December 1877. </explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">the loudspeaker</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the microphone</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the telephone</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>After gaining fame between 1800 and 1815 for his laboratory work in gases and electrochemical reactions, Humphry Davy went on to produce what practical, everyday invention?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">the miner’s safety lamp</answer> <explanation>About 1815 <link id=\"152896\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Sir-Humphry-Davy-Baronet\">Humphry Davy</link> began to study, for the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines, the conditions under which mixtures of firedamp and air explode.

The Old London Bridge was completed by 1209. Almost immediately the bridge became not only an important commercial crossing but also a choice business and residential site. Three years after its completion, a fire destroyed all the buildings and killed as many as 3,000 people. Finally the maintenance became too much of a burden, and the City asked the renowned engineer John Rennie to design a wholly new structure several yards upstream. In 1831 King William IV and Queen Adelaide arrived by water to celebrate the opening of the new bridge. Between 1968 and 1971 its facing stone was dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to the U.S. state of Arizona, where it was reerected on Lake Havasu. The third London Bridge was built between 1968 and 1972.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Iowa-class battleships</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Fulton steamboats</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the last electric trolleys</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What is the common name for polyhexamethylene adipamide, the first wholly synthetic fibre ever produced?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">nylon</answer> <explanation>In October 1938, DuPont announced the invention of the first wholly synthetic fibre ever produced.

Volta began experimenting in 1794 with metals alone and found that animal tissue was not needed to produce a current. This finding provoked much controversy between the animal-electricity adherents and the metallic-electricity advocates, but, with his demonstration of the first electric battery in 1800, victory was assured for Volta. In 1801 in Paris, he gave a demonstration of his battery’s generation of electric current before Napoleon, who made Volta a count and senator of the kingdom of Lombardy.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">breech-loading artillery</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">electric telegraph</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">brass cartridge</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Early windmills transformed the kinetic energy of wind into what form of energy?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">mechanical</answer> <explanation><link id=\"645158\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/technology/windmill\">Windmills</link>, like waterwheels, were among the original prime movers that replaced animal muscle as a source of power.

The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins.

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society.
