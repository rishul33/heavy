Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},null,null],"hashtags":["philosophy","philosophers","randomizer"],"hashtagsString":"philosophy, philosophers, randomizer","displayDate":[2017,7,26],"contentXml":"<feature id=\"6310\"><quiz level=\"3\" NumOfQuestions=\"10\" isGeneral=\"false\" isVocabulary=\"false\" isTightrope=\"false\" isPopular=\"true\"><timing timed=\"true\" seconds=\"30\"/><metaDescription>Take this Philosophy &amp; Religion quiz at Encyclopedia Britannica to test your knowledge of philosophy and philosophers.</metaDescription><browserTitle>Philosophy 101 Quiz</browserTitle><questionList><qMultipleChoice level=\"2\"><question><query>Which philosopher is best known for his statement <i>cogito ergo sum</i>?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">René Descartes</answer><explanation>After a series of meditations in which he finds rationale to doubt everything he once thought he knew, Descartes comes to the conclusion that, because he is thinking, he must exist, as something must be doing the thinking. <i>Cogito ergo sum</i>, then, translates to <i>I think, therefore I am</i>.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Jean-Paul Sartre</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Socrates</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Plato</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"><question><query>According to Plato, what is knowledge?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">A justified true belief</answer><explanation>Plato concludes that a belief can only be considered knowledge if it is justified and true.

Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society.
