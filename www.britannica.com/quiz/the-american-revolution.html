In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being. Research on potential treatments and preventive medicine has expanded greatly with the development of modern medicine, and a network of disciplines, including such fields as genetics, psychology, and nutrition, aims to facilitate the betterment of our health.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg","altText":"Health & Medicine","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg"}},{"id":8000,"title":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","urlTitle":"Lifestyles-Social-Issues","description":"It's easy enough to agree that human beings all around the world have certain basic requirements that must be fulfilled in order to ensure their individual and collective well-being. History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word. A literary work can transport us into a fictional, fantastic new world, describe a fleeting feeling, or simply give us a picture of the past through novels, poems, tragedies, epic works, and other genres. Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too. Thanks to human curiosity and technological research, many significant inventions have been made throughout history that in turn made a difference in our daily lives.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg","altText":"Technology","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg"}},{"id":11000,"title":"Visual Arts","urlTitle":"Visual-Arts","description":"These are the arts that meet the eye and evoke an emotion through an expression of skill and imagination. They include the most ancient forms, such as painting and drawing, and the arts that were born thanks to the development of technology, like sculpture, printmaking, photography, and installation art. Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, different eras in art history have had their own principles to define beauty, from the richly ornamented taste of the Baroque to the simple utilitarian style of the Prairie School.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg","altText":"Visual Arts","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg"}},{"id":6000,"title":"World History","urlTitle":"World-History","description":"Does history really repeat itself, or can we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us?

                    <dt>Question: How many British colonies formed the United States of America?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-colonies" class="md-crosslink">American colonies</a>, also called the thirteen colonies or colonial America, were the 13 British colonies that were established during the 17th and early 18th centuries in what is now a part of the eastern United States. The colonies grew both geographically along the Atlantic coast and westward and numerically to 13 from the time of their founding to the American Revolution. They gained independence after the famous revolt in the War of Independence, or <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution" class="md-crosslink">American Revolution</a>, to form the United States of America.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which battles marked the beginning of the American Revolution?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battles-of-Lexington-and-Concord" class="md-crosslink">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> were the initial battles between British regulars and American provincials, which marked the beginning of the American Revolution. The British Army set out from Boston to seize the colonists military stores at Concord, causing a clash between the British forces and the American colonists. This experience established guerrilla warfare as the colonists’ best defense strategy against the British. The battles confirmed the alienation between the majority of colonists and the mother country. </dd>

They took their name from a speech given in the British Parliament by Isaac Barré in 1765, in which he referred to the colonials who had opposed unjust British measures as the “sons of liberty.” The origins of the Sons of Liberty were unclear, but the group often met under cover of darkness beneath the Liberty Tree, a stately elm tree in Hanover Square, and supported colonial resistance through the use of petitions, assemblies, and propaganda, and they sometimes resorted to violence against British officials.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: What was the name given to the American colonists who supported Great Britain during the American Revolution?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/loyalist" class="md-crosslink">Loyalists</a>, also called Tories, were the colonists who were loyal to Great Britain during the American Revolution. They constituted about one-third of the population of the American colonies during that conflict. The Loyalists were not confined to any particular group or class, but their numbers were strongest among the following groups: officeholders and others who served the British crown and had a vested interest in upholding its authority; Anglican clergymen and their parishioners in the North, who had likewise taken vows of allegiance and obedience to the king; Quakers, members of German religious sects, and other pacifists; and large landholders, especially in the North, and wealthy merchant groups in the cities whose businesses and property were affected by the war.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Declaration-of-Independence" class="md-crosslink">Declaration of Independence</a>, in U.S. history, was the document that was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, that announced the separation of 13 North American British colonies from Great Britain. It explained why the colonies had chosen to separate themselves from Great Britain. Accordingly, the day on which final separation was officially voted was July 2, and the 4th, the day on which the Declaration of Independence was adopted, has always been celebrated in the United States as the national holiday—the Fourth of July, or Independence Day.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: In which year was the Stamp Act, the first British parliamentary attempt to raise revenue through direct taxation of all colonial commercial and legal papers, newspapers, pamphlets, cards, almanacs, and dice, issued?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Stamp-Act-Great-Britain-1765" class="md-crosslink">Stamp Act</a>, in U.S. colonial history, was the first British parliamentary attempt issued in 1765 to raise revenue through direct taxation of all colonial commercial and legal papers, newspapers, pamphlets, cards, almanacs, and dice. The devastating effect of Pontiac’s War (1763–64) on colonial frontier settlements added to the enormous new defense burdens resulting from Great Britain’s victory (1763) in the French and Indian War. The British chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir George Grenville, hoped to meet at least half of these costs by the combined revenues of the Sugar Act (1764) and the Stamp Act, a common revenue device in England.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Where did the First Continental Congress take place?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The First <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Continental-Congress" class="md-crosslink">Continental Congress</a> met in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, and convened in response to the Acts by the colonial Committees of Correspondence. Fifty-six deputies represented all the colonies except Georgia, and Peyton Randolph of Virginia was unanimously elected president, thus establishing usage of that term as well as “Congress.”</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Intolerable-Acts" class="md-crosslink">Intolerable Acts</a>, also called the Coercive Acts, in U.S. colonial history, were the four punitive measures enacted by the British Parliament in 1774 in retaliation for acts of colonial defiance, together with the Quebec Act establishing a new administration for the territory ceded to Britain after the French and Indian War.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: What is another name for the American Revolution?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution" class="md-crosslink">American Revolution</a>, also called the United States War of Independence or American Revolutionary War, (1775–83) was the insurrection by which 13 of Great Britain’s North American colonies won political independence and went on to form the United States of America. The war followed more than a decade of growing estrangement between the British crown and a large and influential segment of its North American colonies that was caused by British attempts to assert greater control over colonial affairs.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Bunker-Hill" class="md-crosslink">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> (June 17, 1775) was the first major battle of the American Revolution that was fought in Charlestown (now part of Boston) during the Siege of Boston. Although the British eventually won the battle, it was a Pyrrhic victory that lent considerable encouragement to the revolutionary cause.</dd>

Fort Ticonderoga (in New York) had been held by the British since 1759, and was overrun on the morning of May 10, 1775, in a surprise attack by the Green Mountain Boys under Ethan Allen, assisted by Benedict Arnold. The artillery seized there was moved to Boston by Henry Knox for use against the British.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which act, stating that the British Parliament’s taxing authority was the same in America as in Great Britain, was passed after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Declaratory-Act-Great-Britain-1766" class="md-crosslink">Declaratory Act</a> (1766) was a declaration by the British Parliament that accompanied the repeal of the Stamp Act. It stated that the British Parliament’s taxing authority was the same in America as in Great Britain. Parliament had directly taxed the colonies for revenue in the Sugar Act (1764) and the Stamp Act (1765). Parliament mollified the recalcitrant colonists by repealing the distasteful Stamp Act, but it hardened its principle in the Declaratory Act by asserting its complete authority to make laws binding on the American colonies “in all cases whatsoever.”</dd>

Paine had arrived in America when the conflict between the colonists and England was reaching its height. After the Battles of Lexington and Concord (1775), Paine argued that the cause of America should be not just a revolt against taxation but independence. He put this idea into "Common Sense," which came off the press on January 10, 1776. The 50-page pamphlet sold more than 500,000 copies within a few months. More than any other single publication, "Common Sense" paved the way for the Declaration of Independence, unanimously ratified on July 4, 1776.</dd>

In his four years on Washington’s staff he grew close to the general and was entrusted with his correspondence. He was sent on important military missions and, thanks to his fluent command of French, became liaison officer between Washington and the French generals and admirals.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: When were the Articles of Confederation adopted by the Congress?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Articles-of-Confederation" class="md-crosslink">Articles of Confederation</a>, the first U.S. constitution, served as a bridge between the initial government by the Continental Congress of the Revolutionary period and the federal government provided under the U.S. Constitution of 1787. The Articles were written in 1776–77 and adopted by the Congress on November 15, 1777. However, the document was not fully ratified by the states until March 1, 1781. Because the experience of overbearing British central authority was vivid in colonial minds, the drafters of the Articles deliberately established a confederation of sovereign states.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which convention was held in Philadelphia in 1787, presumably with the original goal of amending the Articles of Confederation?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Constitutional-Convention" class="md-crosslink">Constitutional Convention</a>, in U.S. history, was the convention that drew up the Constitution of the United States. The convention met in the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia (May 25–September 17, 1787) to amend the Articles of Confederation. All the states, except Rhode Island, responded to an invitation issued by the Annapolis Convention of 1786 to send delegates. Of the 74 deputies chosen by the state legislatures, only 55 took part in the proceedings; of these, 39 signed the Constitution.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Society-of-the-Cincinnati" class="md-crosslink">Society of the Cincinnati</a> hereditary, military, and patriotic organization formed in May 1783 by officers who had served in the American Revolution. Its objectives were to promote union and national honour, maintain their war-born friendship, perpetuate the rights for which they had fought, and aid members and their families in case of need. The society took its name from the Roman citizen-soldier Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Shayss-Rebellion" class="md-crosslink">Shays’s Rebellion</a> (1786–1787) was an uprising in western Massachusetts in opposition to high taxes and stringent economic conditions. Armed bands forced the closing of several courts to prevent the execution of foreclosures and debt processes. In September 1786, Daniel Shays and other local leaders led several hundred men in forcing the Supreme Court in Springfield to adjourn. Shays led a force of about 1,200 men in an attack (January 1787) on the federal arsenal at Springfield, which was repulsed. Pursued by the militia, on February 4, he was decisively defeated at Petersham and fled to Vermont. As a result of the rebellion, the Massachusetts legislature enacted laws easing the economic condition of debtors.</dd>

He won fame in 1767–68 as the author of Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies, which appeared in many colonial newspapers. The letters helped turn opinion against the Townshend Acts (1767), under which new duties were collected to pay the salaries of royal officials in the colonies.</dd>

The first great test of the minutemen was at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.</dd>

Washington led 11,000 regulars to take up winter quarters at Valley Forge on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, 22 miles (35 km) northwest of Philadelphia (which at the time was occupied by the British).</dd>

In 1774 he wrote "A Summary View of the Rights of British America," which was quickly published, though without his permission, and catapulted him into visibility beyond Virginia as an early advocate of American independence from Parliament’s authority. The American colonies were tied to Great Britain, he believed, only by wholly voluntary bonds of loyalty to the king.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marquis-de-Lafayette" class="md-crosslink">Marquis de Lafayette</a> was a French aristocrat who fought in the Continental Army with the American colonists against the British in the American Revolution. With no combat experience and not yet 20 years old, Lafayette was nonetheless appointed a major general in the Continental Army, and he quickly struck up a lasting friendship with the American commander in chief, George Washington. The childless general and the orphaned aristocrat seemed an unlikely pair, but they soon developed a surrogate father-son relationship. Later, as a leading advocate for a constitutional monarchy, he became one of the most powerful men in France during the first few years of the French Revolution and during the July Revolution of 1830.</dd>

In August 1779, Jones took command of the Bonhomme Richard and, accompanied by four small ships, sailed around the British Isles. In September, the little squadron intercepted the Baltic merchant fleet under convoy of the British ships Serapis and Countess of Scarborough. What followed was one of the most famous naval engagements in American history. During the early stages of a grueling 3 1/2-hour gun battle, Jones answered an enemy challenge to surrender with the memorable words, “I have not yet begun to fight!”</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Rogers-Clark" class="md-crosslink">George Rogers Clark</a> during the American Revolution was a frontier military leader, whose successes were factors in the award of the Old Northwest to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. At the outbreak of the Revolution, Clark persuaded the Virginia government to make Kentucky a separate county and to authorize him to enlist troops for its defense against the British and Indians along the frontier. In May 1778 Clark, with an expedition of about 175 men, took two Mississippi River settlements—Kaskaskia and Cahokia, both in present-day Illinois. At Kaskaskia, Clark gained the friendship of Pierre Gibault, who induced the French at Vincennes on the Wabash River to change their allegiance. </dd>

Adams was a powerful figure in opposing British authority in the colonies. The passage by Parliament of the Tea Act of 1773, which granted the East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies, gave Adams ample opportunity to exercise his remarkable talents. Although he did not participate in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Boston-Tea-Party" class="md-crosslink">Boston Tea Party</a>, he was undoubtedly one of its planners.</dd>

His troops were brought to a standstill in the Hudson River by a much larger army commanded successively by General Philip Schuyler and General Horatio Gates, and led by Brigadier General Benedict Arnold. Burgoyne surrendered his army to Gates on October 17, north of Saratoga Springs, after he ran out of supplies and options.</dd>
