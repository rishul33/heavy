In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word.

Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: On the event that sparked World War I, <em>The New York Times</em> headline for June 29, 1914, was “HEIR TO AUSTRIA'S THRONE IS” what?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Archduke <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Franz-Ferdinand-Archduke-of-Austria-Este" class="md-crosslink">Franz Ferdinand</a>, the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph’s heir, was shot dead by a Serbian. This gave Austria-Hungary, backed by its ally Germany, a pretext to start a war with Serbia, which was allied with Russia, which in turn was allied with France.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: What caused Great Britain to join World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Under the Treaty of London of 1839, Britain had agreed to defend Belgium. It declared war on Germany within hours of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Schlieffen-Plan" class="md-crosslink">kaiser’s men marching through neutral Belgium</a>.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: What novel way were French troops transported to the First Battle of the Marne, just 30 miles from Paris?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Germany’s all-out offensive early in the war saw its troops reach the Marne River about 30 miles from Paris. To halt their advance, French soldiers needed to be rushed to the front, but trucks were unavailable and railways were clogged. Consequently, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Battle-of-the-Marne" class="md-crosslink">600 of the city’s taxis</a> were used to transport 3,000 French troops to the front—a relatively small number that had a large impact.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: How were aircraft primarily used at the beginning of World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The fledgling aviation industry of the 1910s produced planes so light that they could carry only a pilot and perhaps an observer. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/military-aircraft" class="md-crosslink">reconnaissance work</a> done by these fliers improved the accuracy of artillery fire tremendously.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which of these best describes how trenches were dug on the Western Front?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/trench-warfare" class="md-crosslink">Trenches</a> were dug in zigzag patterns so that enemy soldiers who infiltrated a trench could shoot only a few yards along it rather than along its entire length More-developed trenches included blind alleys and dead ends to confuse infiltrators.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which animals were frequently used to carry messages during World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Because new communications technology like radio was unreliable, both the Allies and the Central Powers turned to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/military-communication" class="md-crosslink">carrier&nbsp;pigeons</a> to relay short messages tied to the birds’ legs. Pigeons were carried aboard tanks, airplanes, and submarines.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which of these innovations helped end World War I-style trench warfare?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: For most of World War I, taking an opposing trench meant sending a massive number of soldiers traipsing across an artillery-shelled no-man’s-land into a hail of enemy bullets. As the war went on, however, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/tank-military-vehicle" class="md-crosslink">tanks</a> became nimble enough to maneuver through rugged terrain, including trenches, while shielding their gunners from machine-gun fire.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which of the following is true about the Battle of Verdun, one of the bloodiest battles of World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Fought over the course of February to December 1916, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Verdun" class="md-crosslink">Battle of Verdun</a> lasted 300 days. Millions of shells were fired during the 10-month-long battle, killing about 300,000 French and German soldiers and wiping nine French villages completely off the map. An area of 1,200 square kilometers around Verdun remains a “Red Zone,” deemed too dangerous to inhabit, because it's still riddled with unexploded shells.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Why did Russia quit fighting World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: By November 1916 Russia had lost 1,700,000 soldiers, and peasants faced frequent food shortages. Leadership was so poor that it was rumored to be treasonous. By March 1917 the situation had deteriorated so much that Russia’s ruler, the tsar Nicholas II, abdicated. His brother the grand duke Michael refused the throne, effectively ending the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romanov-dynasty" class="md-crosslink">Romanov dynasty</a>. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Russian-Revolution" class="md-crosslink">communist leaders</a> who eventually seized power recognized the independence of previously Russian-held lands, including Finland and Ukraine, to obtain peace with the Central Powers in March 1918.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: The “Zimmermann Telegram” revealed Germany’s intent to entice which country to join it against the U.S.?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: In 1917 Germany’s foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, sent an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Zimmermann-Telegram" class="md-crosslink">encoded telegram</a> instructing its ambassador to Mexico to seek an alliance with that country in case the U.S. entered World War I. British intelligence deciphered the message and shared it with the U.S., which contributed to the U.S. decision to enter the war.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which nickname was given to U.S. infantrymen?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: European soldiers initially called their&nbsp;American counterparts "Yanks" or "Sammies," but the U.S. infantrymen called themselves “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/doughboy" class="md-crosslink">doughboys</a>,” and the name caught on. At least as early as the Mexican-American War, the term had been used with mild&nbsp;derision by cavalrymen and soldiers in other U.S. Army branches to refer to their comrades in the infantry, who usually had to travel on foot. The origin of this use&nbsp;of "doughboy" is uncertain.&nbsp;One theory is that it referred to the often muddy terrain infantrymen had to trudge through, "kneading" the earth like dough. Others suggest that it referred to the&nbsp;doughlike color that&nbsp;earth-covered infantry uniforms could take on.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Germany tried to justify sinking the passenger ocean liner <em>Lusitania</em> by making which claim?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lusitania-British-ship" class="md-crosslink"><em>Lusitania</em></a> was sunk in 1915, with 128 American citizens aboard, as a victim of Germany’s “unrestricted <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/U-boat" class="md-crosslink">submarine</a> warfare”—attacking any ship, military or civilian, that approached Great Britain. Although Germany claimed—correctly, as it turned out—that the ship was also carrying ammunition to Britain, making it a legitimate target, the U.S. was still furious. To keep America out of the fighting, Germany agreed to give up unrestricted submarine warfare. After two years, however, it resumed the tactic, which proved to be a major cause of the U.S. entry into the war.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Before becoming Britain’s leader during World War II, which of these did Winston Churchill do during World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Britain tried to relieve pressure on Russia by attacking the Ottoman Empire. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Winston-Churchill" class="md-crosslink">Winston Churchill</a>, at the time Britain’s first lord of the Admiralty, chose the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Gallipoli-Campaign" class="md-crosslink">Dardanelles</a> channel in Turkey as the place to open a front. In January 1915 the British planned to secure the waterway with naval power alone. A month later the plan was modified to include capturing the surrounding shores. The naval attack began on February 19 and the landings on April 25. The assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula was a debacle, costing tens of thousands of British Commonwealth lives before a full retreat was made. Although many in leadership roles contributed to the ill-fated campaign, Churchill was seen as the venture’s chief protagonist. He was demoted and eventually resigned from the government.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: British officer Thomas Edward Lawrence taught guerrilla warfare tactics, crucial to defeating the Ottoman Empire, to which group?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/T-E-Lawrence" class="md-crosslink">T.E. Lawrence</a>, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, helped train and organize Arab fighters eager to throw off the yoke of their Turkish oppressors in the Ottoman Empire by using <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/guerrilla" class="md-crosslink">guerrilla warfare</a>. With those forces, Lawrence claimed to have blown up 79 railway bridges.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Germany developed cannons able to fire shells more than 75 miles to bombard which city?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: With 112-foot-long barrels, the so-called <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Paris-Gun" class="md-crosslink">Paris guns</a> had three times the range of previous cannons. Over a quarter ton of gunpowder was used to send shells into the stratosphere, where atmospheric drag was essentially nonexistent. Despite their impressive size, the Paris guns killed only about 250 Parisians, so their impact on the war was small.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: The close quarters soldiers kept in World War I helped spread which disease, resulting in an estimated 25 million deaths?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/influenza-pandemic-of-1918-1919" class="md-crosslink">influenza pandemic of 1918–19</a> is often referred to as “the Spanish flu,” but it did <em>not</em> originate in Spain. Other countries were just as ravaged by the illness but did not want to appear weak while at war, so they refused to admit that they had any cases. Newspapers in Spain, a neutral country, covered the illness extensively.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Alvin York won the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. military decoration, for doing what?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Thanks to his years of hunting around his Tennessee home, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alvin-Cullum-York" class="md-crosslink">Alvin York</a> was an accomplished sharpshooter even before the war began. While on patrol during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive (October 1918), he rapidly picked off more than two dozen Germans in a machine-gun encampment, prompting many others to surrender. York won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroics and was later portrayed by Gary Cooper in a movie about his life.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which deadly World War I weapon was outlawed in the Geneva Protocol of 1925?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/phosgene" class="md-crosslink">Phosgene</a>, a poison gas that causes choking, was responsible for the majority of deaths from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/chemical-weapon" class="md-crosslink">chemical weapons</a> in World War I. However, regular use of gas masks eventually negated its effectiveness. Mustard gas, though not as lethal, causes blisters on contact with skin and could soak through soldiers’ uniforms. These gases were banned by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Geneva-Gas-Protocol" class="md-crosslink">Geneva Protocol of 1925</a>.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: Before <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I" class="md-crosslink">World War I</a>, military forces like the French army depended on the bayonet as a decisive instrument of war. However, other weapons, developed through industrialization and mechanization, brought casualties in World War I to a level never before seen. About 8,500,000 soldiers died during the war. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artillery" class="md-crosslink">Artillery</a> fire killed the most, followed by small arms and then poison gas.</dd>

Having been named the war’s aggressor, Germany was ordered to pay more than $30 billion in reparations, an astronomical sum, which contributed to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/hyperinflation-in-the-Weimar-Republic" class="md-crosslink">hyperinflation</a>. The resulting hardship, along with other humiliations, helped fuel <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nazi-Party" class="md-crosslink">German fascists</a>’ rise to power in the 1930s.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: Many European countries joined the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/League-of-Nations" class="md-crosslink">League of Nations</a> in the hope of avoiding future catastrophes that would be like World War I. However, Wilson faced trouble at home from political opponents who preferred isolation to further entanglement in European affairs.

This unsuccessful military operation, planned by the Russian minister of war Aleksandr Kerensky, demonstrated not only the degree to which the Russian army had disintegrated but also the extent of the Provisional Government’s failure to interpret and respond adequately to popular revolutionary sentiment.</dd>

In the spring of 1916 Brusilov succeeded the elderly and irresolute general N.Y. Ivanov as commander of the four Russian armies in the southwestern sector of the Eastern Front. From June 4 Brusilov led these armies, which had been billeted south of the Pripet Marshes, in a massive attack against Austro-Hungarian forces.</dd>

The second son of Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII, he served in the navy until the death (1892) of his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, required him to undertake more-specialized training as eventual heir to the throne. Respect for King George greatly increased during World War I, and he visited the front in France several times. After the war, the king was confronted by an outbreak of industrial unrest.</dd>

The treaty officially registered the breakup of the Habsburg empire, recognizing the independence of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) and ceding eastern Galicia to Poland and ceding Trento, southern Tirol, Trieste, and Istria to Italy. Plebiscites eventually determined the disposition of southern Carinthia (which went to Austria) and the town of Sopron (which went to Hungary).</dd>

However, in 1915 he transferred to the Imperial Air Service and in September 1916 entered combat as a fighter pilot. He became commander of Fighter Wing I, which, because of its frequent moves by rail and its fancifully decorated planes, came to be known as Richthofen’s Flying Circus, and he was credited with shooting down 80 enemy aircraft. He was killed in his red Fokker triplane in 1918—according to one account, when he was caught in a barrage of Australian enemy ground fire during a battle near Amiens.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Schlieffen-Plan" class="md-crosslink">Schlieffen Plan</a> was first proposed in 1905 by Alfred, Graf (count) von Schlieffen, chief of the German general staff, to allow Germany to wage a successful two-front war. The plan was heavily modified by Schlieffen’s successor, Helmuth von Moltke, before and during its implementation in World War I. The uniqueness of the Schlieffen Plan was that it ran counter to prevailing German military wisdom, which was principally derived from Carl von Clausewitz’s seminal work <em>On War</em> (1832) and the strategic thought of the elder Helmuth von Moltke.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: When did the United States enter World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: After the rupture of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Germany on February 3, 1917, events pushed the U.S. inexorably toward its entry into <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I" class="md-crosslink">World War I</a>. That entry was a turning point in the war, because it made the eventual defeat of Germany possible. The U.S. Navy was the second largest in the world when America entered the war in 1917. The navy soon abandoned its plans for the construction of battleships and instead concentrated on building destroyers and submarine chasers, which were desperately needed to protect Allied shipping from German U-boats. By July 1917 there were already 35 U.S. destroyers stationed at Queenstown (Cobh), on the coast of Ireland—enough to supplement British destroyers for an effective transatlantic convoy system. By the end of the war there were more than 380 U.S. naval craft stationed overseas.</dd>

U-boats were a spectacular feature of both World Wars I and II. Germany was the first country to employ submarines in war as substitutes for surface commerce raiders. Though numbering only 38 at the outset of World War I, U-boats achieved notable successes against British warships. However, because of the reactions of neutral powers (especially the United States), Germany hesitated before adopting unrestricted U-boat warfare against merchant ships.</dd>

Germany and Austria-Hungary had been allied since 1879, and Italy sought their support against France shortly after its ambitions in North Africa were checked by the French. The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary would assist Italy if it were attacked by France without Italian provocation and that Italy would assist Germany if Germany were attacked by France. In the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Italy promised to remain neutral.</dd>

The defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army consigned the centuries-old empire to the pages of history and dramatically changed the political map of central Europe.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Who was the last surviving American World War I veteran?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Frank Woodruff Buckles was an American serviceman who was the last surviving American veteran of World War I. He enlisted at the age of 16, and he served as a clerk and an ambulance driver in England and then France. After the war, Buckles lived quietly as a West Virginia farmer until 2008, when it was officially determined that he was the last of the 4,734,991 Americans identified as veterans of World War I. He spent his final years lobbying for the creation of a national World War I monument in Washington, D.C. In 2008 the U.S. government agreed to waive the usual requirements so that “the last living doughboy” could be buried in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Arlington-National-Cemetery" class="md-crosslink">Arlington National Cemetery</a>.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-II-emperor-of-Germany" class="md-crosslink">William II</a> (in German, Wilhelm II) was the German emperor (or kaiser) and the king of Prussia from 1888 to the end of World War I in 1918. He was known for his frequently militaristic manner as well as for his vacillating policies.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Tannenberg-World-War-I-1914" class="md-crosslink">Battle of Tannenberg</a> was a World War I battle fought at Tannenberg, East Prussia (now Stębark, Poland), that ended in a German victory over the Russians. The crushing Russian defeat, which occurred barely a month into the conflict, became emblematic of the Russian Empire’s experience in World War I.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maximilian-Graf-von-Spee" class="md-crosslink">Maximilian, Graf (count) von Spee</a>, commanded German naval forces in the battles of Coronel and the Falkland (or Malvinas) Islands early in World War I. He entered the German navy in 1878, and in 1887–88 he commanded the port in German Cameroon.

                    <dt>Question: Which convention was also known as the Asia Minor Agreement?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Sykes-Picot-Agreement" class="md-crosslink">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a>, also called the Asia Minor Agreement (May 1916), was a secret convention made during World War I between Great Britain and France, with the assent of imperial Russia, for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. The agreement led to the division of Ottoman-held Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine into various French- and British-administered areas. Negotiations were begun in November 1915, and the final agreement took its name from the chief negotiators of Britain and France, Sir Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot.</dd>
