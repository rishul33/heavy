This recommendation was based upon the idea that by this point in Earth’s history, plutonium isotopes caused by nuclear-weapons-testing fallout would be concentrated enough to serve as an observable signal in rock strata.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Holocene Epoch</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Ordovician Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Carboniferous Period</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"><question><query>The highest global temperatures during the most-recent 66 million years occurred near the boundary between which two geologic epochs?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Paleocene and Eocene</answer><explanation>The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), also called Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum (IETM), was a short interval of maximum temperature lasting approximately 100,000 years during the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs (roughly 56 million years ago). The interval was characterized by the highest global temperatures of the Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to the present).</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Oligocene and Miocene</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Pleistocene and Holocene</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Pliocene and Anthropocene</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"1\"><question><query>The “Age of Fishes” occurred during which interval?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Devonian Period</answer><explanation>The Devonian Period is sometimes called the “Age of Fishes” because of the diverse, abundant, and, in some cases, bizarre types of those creatures that swam Devonian seas. Forests and the coiled-shell-bearing marine organisms known as ammonites first appeared early in the Devonian. Late in the period the first four-legged amphibians appeared, indicating the colonization of land by vertebrates.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Proterozoic Eon</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Triassic Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Quaternary Period</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"2\"><question><query>The greatest mass extinction in Earth’s history occurred at the end of this period.</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Permian Period</answer><explanation>The Permian extinction (about 266 million to 252 million years ago) produced the most-dramatic die-off, eliminating about half of all families, some 95 percent of marine species (nearly wiping out brachiopods and corals), and about 70 percent of land species (including plants, insects, and vertebrates).</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Silurian Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Cretaceous Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Jurassic Period</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"2\"><question><query>The unparalleled emergence of organisms, including 20–35 of the major phyla of animals that occur on Earth today, took place during which interval?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Cambrian Period</answer><explanation><i>Cambrian explosion</i> is the term used to describe the unparalleled emergence of organisms between 541 million and approximately 530 million years ago, at the beginning of the Cambrian Period.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Carboniferous Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Silurian Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Cretaceous Period</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"><question><query>For some 65 million years of this period’s 85-million-year span, much if not all of Earth’s surface was covered in ice.</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Cryogenian Period</answer><explanation>The Cryogenian’s longest glaciation, the Sturtian, lasted for the period’s first 50 million–60 million years. After a brief interglacial, a second cold interval, the Marinoan glaciation, dominated the planet for most of the period’s final 15 million years.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Carboniferous Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Cretaceous Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Cambrian Period</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"><question><query><i>Homo sapiens</i> is thought to have first evolved during this epoch.</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Pleistocene Epoch</answer><explanation>Some paleoanthropologists extend the span of this species far back into time to include many anatomically distinctive fossils that others prefer to allocate to several different extinct species. In contrast, a majority of paleoanthropologists, wishing to bring the study of hominins into line with that of other mammals, prefer to assign to <i>Homo sapiens</i> (the species that contains modern human beings) only those fossil forms that fall within the anatomic spectrum of the species as it exists today. In this sense, <i>Homo sapiens</i> is very recent, originating in Africa less than 200,000 years ago (200 kya) near the end of the Pleistocene Epoch.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Anthropocene Epoch</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Holocene Epoch</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Miocene Epoch</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"><question><query>This period was characterized by the emergence of coal swamps and the dominance of vascular land plants.</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Carboniferous Period</answer><explanation>Carboniferous terrestrial environments were dominated by vascular land plants ranging from small shrubby growths to trees exceeding heights of 100 feet (30 meters). The most-important groups were the lycopods, the sphenopsids, the cordaites, the seed ferns, and the true ferns. The name Carboniferous refers to coal-bearing rock strata that characterize the upper portion of the series throughout the world.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Cretaceous Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Devonian Period</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Triassic Period</answer></qMultipleChoice></questionList></quiz></feature>","urlTitle":"name-that-geologic-interval","typeDisplayName":"Quiz","cssClassName":"QUIZ","mainCategory":{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens.

For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Charlemagne was the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Charlemagne was the king of the Franks and of the Lombards, ruling parts of Germany, France, and Italy. He was crowned and acclaimed as “Augustus and emperor” by Pope Leo III in 800.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: The period of Charlemagne’s rule is called the Restoration.</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The cultural revival during Charlemagne’s reign is known as the Carolingian Renaissance, after his Latin name, Carolus Magnus. </dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Charlemagne was greatly interested in education.</dt>
