The term <i>knot</i> probably results from its former use as a length measure on shipsâ log lines, which were used to measure the speed of a ship through the water. Such a line was marked off at intervals by knots tied in the rope. Each interval, or knot, was about 47 feet (14.3 metres) long. When the log was tossed overboard, it remained more or less stationary while its attached log line trailed out from the vessel as the latter moved forward. After 28 seconds had elapsed, the number of knots that had passed overboard was counted. The number of knots that ran out in 28 seconds was roughly the speed of the ship in nautical miles per hour.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">depth of a harbour</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">weight of an anchor</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">height of a mast</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What early vehicles were known as âboneshakersâ?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">bicycles</answer> <explanation>The hard ride of wood-spoked wheels and iron rims gave early velocipedes the sobriquet of âboneshaker,â but solid rubber tires and wire-spoked wheels helped soften the ride.

Some earlier researchers had theorized that each sound, if it could be graphically recorded, would produce a distinct shape resembling shorthand, or phonography (âsound writingâ), as it was then known. Edison hoped to reify this concept by employing a stylus-tipped carbon transmitter to make impressions on a strip of paraffined paper. To his astonishment, the scarcely visible indentations generated a vague reproduction of sound when the paper was pulled back beneath the stylus. Edison unveiled the tinfoil phonograph, which replaced the strip of paper with a cylinder wrapped in tinfoil, in December 1877. </explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">the loudspeaker</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the microphone</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the telephone</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>After gaining fame between 1800 and 1815 for his laboratory work in gases and electrochemical reactions, Humphry Davy went on to produce what practical, everyday invention?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">the minerâs safety lamp</answer> <explanation>About 1815 <link id=\"152896\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Sir-Humphry-Davy-Baronet\">Humphry Davy</link> began to study, for the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines, the conditions under which mixtures of firedamp and air explode.

The Old London Bridge was completed by 1209. Almost immediately the bridge became not only an important commercial crossing but also a choice business and residential site. Three years after its completion, a fire destroyed all the buildings and killed as many as 3,000 people. Finally the maintenance became too much of a burden, and the City asked the renowned engineer John Rennie to design a wholly new structure several yards upstream. In 1831 King William IV and Queen Adelaide arrived by water to celebrate the opening of the new bridge. Between 1968 and 1971 its facing stone was dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to the U.S. state of Arizona, where it was reerected on Lake Havasu.

Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}}}]

Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interactânot only with each other but also with their environmentâhas been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens.
