The term <i>knot</i> probably results from its former use as a length measure on ships’ log lines, which were used to measure the speed of a ship through the water. Such a line was marked off at intervals by knots tied in the rope. Each interval, or knot, was about 47 feet (14.3 metres) long. When the log was tossed overboard, it remained more or less stationary while its attached log line trailed out from the vessel as the latter moved forward. After 28 seconds had elapsed, the number of knots that had passed overboard was counted. The number of knots that ran out in 28 seconds was roughly the speed of the ship in nautical miles per hour.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">depth of a harbour</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">weight of an anchor</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">height of a mast</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What early vehicles were known as “boneshakers”?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">bicycles</answer> <explanation>The hard ride of wood-spoked wheels and iron rims gave early velocipedes the sobriquet of “boneshaker,” but solid rubber tires and wire-spoked wheels helped soften the ride.

In this procedure a narrow beam of X-rays sweeps across an area of the body and is recorded not on film but by a radiation detector as a pattern of electrical impulses. Data from many such sweeps are integrated by a computer, which uses the radiation-absorption figures to assess the density of tissues at thousands of points. The density values appear on a television-like screen as points of varying brightness to produce a detailed cross-sectional image, like a slice, of the internal structure under scrutiny.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">X-ray photography</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">positron emission tomography</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">ultrasonography</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>For his visual signal line, employing a series of towers rigged with two arms that adopted various positions, French engineer Claude Chappe coined which term?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">semaphore</answer> <explanation><link id=\"106172\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Claude-Chappe\">Claude Chappe</link> and his brother Ignace built a series of towers on heights between Paris and Lille.

With it he could obtain a large voltage change at the plate for a small voltage change on the grid electrode. This was a discovery of major importance because it made it possible to amplify the radio-frequency signal picked up by the antenna before application to the receiver detector; thus, much weaker signals could be utilized than had previously been possible.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">wireless telegraphs</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">television</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">microwave ovens</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In 1877 Thomas Alva Edison made indentations in a strip of coated paper with a stylus connected to a transmitter. When he pulled the strip back through the apparatus, he was astonished to hear that it produced a sound. What had he just invented?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">the phonograph</answer> <explanation>In 1877 <link id=\"179233\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Thomas-Edison\">Thomas Alva Edison</link> achieved his most original discovery, the <link id=\"457279\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/technology/phonograph\">phonograph</link>. Some earlier researchers had theorized that each sound, if it could be graphically recorded, would produce a distinct shape resembling shorthand, or phonography (“sound writing”), as it was then known. Edison hoped to reify this concept by employing a stylus-tipped carbon transmitter to make impressions on a strip of paraffined paper. To his astonishment, the scarcely visible indentations generated a vague reproduction of sound when the paper was pulled back beneath the stylus. Edison unveiled the tinfoil phonograph, which replaced the strip of paper with a cylinder wrapped in tinfoil, in December 1877. </explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">the loudspeaker</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the microphone</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the telephone</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>After gaining fame between 1800 and 1815 for his laboratory work in gases and electrochemical reactions, Humphry Davy went on to produce what practical, everyday invention?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">the miner’s safety lamp</answer> <explanation>About 1815 <link id=\"152896\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Sir-Humphry-Davy-Baronet\">Humphry Davy</link> began to study, for the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines, the conditions under which mixtures of firedamp and air explode.

The Old London Bridge was completed by 1209. Almost immediately the bridge became not only an important commercial crossing but also a choice business and residential site. Three years after its completion, a fire destroyed all the buildings and killed as many as 3,000 people. Finally the maintenance became too much of a burden, and the City asked the renowned engineer John Rennie to design a wholly new structure several yards upstream. In 1831 King William IV and Queen Adelaide arrived by water to celebrate the opening of the new bridge. Between 1968 and 1971 its facing stone was dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to the U.S. state of Arizona, where it was reerected on Lake Havasu. The third London Bridge was built between 1968 and 1972.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Iowa-class battleships</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Fulton steamboats</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">the last electric trolleys</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What is the common name for polyhexamethylene adipamide, the first wholly synthetic fibre ever produced?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">nylon</answer> <explanation>In October 1938, DuPont announced the invention of the first wholly synthetic fibre ever produced.

In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens.

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.
