Since the switch to the Gregorian calendar was mandated by the Roman Catholic Church, Protestant and Orthodox countries were reluctant to accept it and remained on the Julian calendar. England and its American colonies remained on the Julian calendar until 1752. By that time the discrepancy between the Julian and Gregorian calendars had grown to 11 days. So Britain’s calendar was brought into conformity with that used in continental Europe, whereby September 3, 1752, was changed to September 14. The adoption of the new calendar, though it ultimately benefited commerce and international relations, played havoc with monthly rental payments and wages, and English crowds sought freedom from getting the short end of the stick.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">during the Nine Years’ War</answer><answer correct=\"false\">after the death of George I</answer><answer correct=\"false\">when Manchester United won their “treble”</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"><question><query>Which American leader was “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen”?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">George Washington</answer><explanation>On December 12, 1799, after riding on horseback for several hours in cold and snow, <link id=\"636381\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/George-Washington\">George Washington</link> returned home exhausted and was attacked late the next day with quinsy or acute laryngitis.

Nixon won nomination as vice president on a ticket with Dwight Eisenhower. In the midst of the campaign, the <i>New York Post</i> reported that Nixon had been maintaining a secret “slush fund” provided by contributions from a group of southern California businessmen. Eisenhower was willing to give Nixon a chance to clear himself. On September 23, 1952, Nixon delivered a nationally televised address, the so-called “Checkers” speech, in which he acknowledged the existence of the fund but denied that any of it had been used improperly. The speech became best known for its conclusion, in which Nixon admitted accepting one political gift—a cocker spaniel that his six-year-old daughter Tricia named Checkers. Although Nixon thought that the speech had been a failure, the public responded favourably, and a reassured Eisenhower told him, “You're my boy.” Nixon had freed himself from the scandal. The Eisenhower-Nixon ticket went on to defeat the Democratic candidates, Adlai E. Stevenson and John Sparkman.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">Adlai Stevenson</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Gerald Ford</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Bob Dole</answer></qMultipleChoice><qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"><question><query>Which American labour activist led a five-year strike against grape growers and a nationwide boycott of grapes?</query></question><answer correct=\"true\">Cesar Chavez</answer><explanation>Cesar Chavez was an organizer of migrant American farmworkers and a cofounder of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in 1962.

Keynes was troubled by the political chicanery and burdensome policies that were to be imposed upon the defeated Germany. He resigned his post, depressed, to quote from a letter to his father, by the impending “devastation of Europe.” In two summer months he composed the indictment of the Versailles settlement that reached the bookstores by Christmas 1919 as <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>. The importance of this polemical essay lies in its economic analysis of the stringent reparations placed upon Germany and the corresponding lack of probability that Germany would ever free itself from its debts. The popular success of the book, however, came from the blistering sketches of Woodrow Wilson, Georges Clemenceau, and Keynes's old chief, Lloyd George.</explanation><answer correct=\"false\">David Lloyd George</answer><answer correct=\"false\">Joseph A.

Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.
