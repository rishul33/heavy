George Washington ran unopposed and won all 69 votes. The first election since the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788 had only 10 states cast electoral votes. New York’s state legislature did not choose electors in time for them to cast votes, and North Carolina and Rhode Island had not yet ratified the Constitution. Congress counted and certified the electoral vote count on April 6. At that time each elector had two votes, and the candidate who received the second most votes was elected as vice president. John Adams was elected the first vice president with 34 electoral votes.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">13</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">50</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">81</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What was the narrowest popular vote margin by which a presidential candidate won a state?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">4</answer> <explanation>In the 1832 presidential election, U.S. Sen. Henry Clay (National Republican) carried Maryland by a margin of 4 votes over incumbent Andrew Jackson (Democrat). From 1824, when the popular vote was first recorded, through 2016, there were 62 cases where a state was carried by a margin of 1,000 votes or fewer, including 4 cases where the margin was less than 100 votes.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">38</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">537</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">1,324</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"3\"> <question> <query>George Washington aside, which nonincumbent presidential candidate won the highest share of the electoral college vote?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Ronald Reagan</answer> <explanation>In the 1980 presidential election, Gov. Ronald Reagan (Republican) won 90.9 percent of the electoral college vote over incumbent Jimmy Carter (Democrat). Reagan carried 44 states, winning 489 electoral votes. Aside from George Washington’s win with 100 percent of the electoral college in the first presidential election in 1789, this was the best performance by a nonincumbent in presidential history.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Abraham Lincoln</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Franklin D.

Warren Harding (Republican) defeated Ohio Gov. James Cox (Democrat) by a margin of 26.23 percent in the national popular vote, the largest margin since the vote was first recorded in 1824. The second largest margin occurred in the 1924 presidential election.

Davis (Democrat) by a margin of just over 25 percent.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">1932</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">1984</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">1964</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Which third-party candidate received the highest share of the popular vote?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Theodore Roosevelt</answer> <explanation>In the 1912 presidential election, former president Theodore Roosevelt won 27.39 percent of the popular vote on the Progressive Party ticket after unsuccessfully challenging incumbent William Howard Taft for the Republican nomination. Roosevelt first succeeded to the presidency in 1901 and won election to a full term in 1904. Roosevelt bested Taft, becoming the only third-party candidate to place second in the electoral college or in the popular vote. However, Gov. Woodrow Wilson (Democrat) won the election with 41.8 percent of the popular vote.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">George Wallace</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Robert La Follette</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Ross Perot</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Which presidential election had the highest estimated voter turnout?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">1876</answer> <explanation>In the presidential election of 1876, an estimated 82.6 percent of the voting-eligible population cast ballots, the highest estimated turnout figure in U.S. history. That year Gov. Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio (Republican) defeated Gov. Samuel Tilden of New York (Democrat) to win the presidency. The results of the election were not immediately clear, however, with both parties claiming victory in Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina. The dispute was resolved in the Compromise of 1877, under which Hayes won the presidency in exchange for withdrawing federal troops from Southern states, bringing an end to the Reconstruction period.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">2008</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">1968</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">1860</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Which presidential election featured the smallest margin in the popular vote?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">1880</answer> <explanation>The presidential election with the smallest margin in the popular vote occurred in 1880. That year James Garfield (Republican) defeated Winfield Scott Hancock (Democrat) by a margin of 214 to 155 in the electoral college. In the popular vote, Garfield’s margin over Hancock was 0.09 percent. Out of the 38 states at the time of the election, 6 were decided by margins of 2 percent or less, giving Hancock 5 of California's 6 electoral college votes and all of New Jersey’s 9 votes and Garfield a combined 59 votes from Indiana, Oregon, New York, and Connecticut. The 1880 election was also among the top five in recorded voter turnout with an 80.5 percent turnout rate among the voting-eligible population.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">1968</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">2000</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">1860</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>How many candidates have won the presidency without winning more than 60 percent of the vote in any state?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Two</answer> <explanation>Only two candidates have won the presidency without receiving more than 60 percent of the vote in any state, according to a SmartPolitics analysis of presidential elections: Richard Nixon (Republican) in 1968 and Bill Clinton (Democrat) in 1992.

As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins.
