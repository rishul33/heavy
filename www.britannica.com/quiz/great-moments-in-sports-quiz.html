The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

                    <dt>Question: In 1972, what National Football League (NFL) team became the first (and, as of 2021, the only) to have a perfect season by winning every game?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Miami-Dolphins" class="md-crosslink">Miami Dolphins</a> made history in 1972 by winning every regular-season game on their way to a Super Bowl victory (17–0). The feat, which has yet to be duplicated, is even more impressive considering starting quarterback Bob Griese was injured during the fifth game of the season, requiring backup QB Earl Morrall to step up for nine wins.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Putting up a staggering 100 points, who holds the record for most points scored in a single National Basketball Association (NBA) game?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: During the March 2, 1962, match between <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilt-Chamberlain" class="md-crosslink">Wilt Chamberlain</a>’s Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks, Chamberlain was 36 of 63 from the field and made 28 of 32 free throw attempts (this occurred before the 3-point era) for a combined 100 points. The closest to match this feat was an 81-point effort in 2006 by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kobe-Bryant" class="md-crosslink">Kobe Bryant</a> of the Los Angeles Lakers.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Following a car accident that left Tiger Woods hospitalized, many professional golfers wore what color shirt to show support for him?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tiger-Woods" class="md-crosslink">Tiger Woods</a> traditionally wears a red shirt on Sundays while playing in the final round of his tournaments as a tribute to his mother, who said red was his “power color.” After a rollover car crash left him hospitalized in early 2021, many of his fellow golfers paid him tribute by donning red.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: During what was dubbed the “Flu Game,” which visibly ailing superstar put up 38 points during a National Basketball Association (NBA) finals game?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Despite not being able to keep food down in the early hours before game five of the 1997 NBA finals, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Jordan" class="md-crosslink">Michael Jordan</a> took the court and put up 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals, pulling the Bulls ahead of the Utah Jazz 3–2 in the series. Jordan initially claimed to have had the flu but has since said it was a case of food poisoning. Jordan’s personal trainer at the time, Tim Grover, added that a suspicious group of five men had delivered pizza the night before and are believed to have tampered with the food.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: The final seconds of the 1982 football game between rivals University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford ended in what memorable way?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: With just four seconds left on the clock, the leading <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University" class="md-crosslink">Stanford</a> Cardinals squibbed to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-California" class="md-crosslink">University of California</a> (Cal), Berkeley, Golden Bears. During a series of lateral passes, Dwight Garner appeared to some observers, including the Stanford marching band, to be down, ending the game. The marching band took the field in celebration, but Garner was not ruled down. After two more Cal laterals, Kevin Moen weaved through the band to make it into the end zone, trouncing a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/trombone" class="md-crosslink">trombone</a> player in the process in what became known as “The Play.”</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Al Michaels’s famous “Do you believe in miracles?” call came during what underdog’s win?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Before 1980 the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union" class="md-crosslink">U.S.S.R.</a> men’s hockey team had won gold in the previous four <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games" class="md-crosslink">Olympics</a>. In their 12 matches between 1960 and 1980, they outscored the U.S. team 117–26. A week before the 1980 Olympics, the Soviets trounced the U.S. team during an exhibition game at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Madison-Square-Garden" class="md-crosslink">Madison Square Garden</a> 10–3. Despite being the underdog, the U.S. team beat the U.S.S.R. team 4–3 in a semifinal game dubbed the “Miracle on Ice” and went on to win a gold medal by defeating Finland in the finals.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Muhammad Ali and George Foreman’s classic boxing match, called&nbsp;the “Rumble in the Jungle,” took place in what country?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Boxing promoter <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Don-King" class="md-crosslink">Don King</a> got both <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Foreman" class="md-crosslink">George Foreman</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammad-Ali-boxer" class="md-crosslink">Muhammad Ali</a> to agree to fight for $5 million each, but he had trouble finding financing. He turned to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo" class="md-crosslink">Zaire</a> dictator <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mobutu-Sese-Seko" class="md-crosslink">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>, who, looking to generate some good publicity, used $10 million from the public treasury to finance the match as long as it was fought in his country.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: In 2016 the Chicago Cubs won the World Series, breaking a decades-long “curse” said to have been brought on by what animal?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chicago-Cubs" class="md-crosslink">Chicago Cubs</a> won the World Series in 1908 and made it back to the Fall Classic seven more times until 1945. That year, during game four, tavern owner Billy Sianis bought two tickets to the game and used the second for his billy goat, Murphy. Sianis was asked to leave because of the goat’s smell. When the Cubs lost the series, Sianis sent a telegraph to team owner P.K. Wrigley asking, “Who stinks now?” The Cubs would not make it to a World Series again until 2016.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Fill in the blank in this <em>New York World-Telegram</em> headline that followed game three of the 1932 World Series: “__ Calls Shot as He Puts Home Run No. 2 in Side Pocket.”</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: There is some debate as to whether <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Babe-Ruth" class="md-crosslink">Babe Ruth</a> truly predicted the spot of a home run in the 1932 World Series. He definitely extended his fingers to the outfield before hitting one out of the park. Some sources at the ballpark that day said Ruth was simply indicating how many strikes he had in the count. Others, including teammate <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lou-Gehrig" class="md-crosslink">Lou Gehrig</a>, backed the legendary tale of the Great Bambino calling his shot.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Serena-Williams" class="md-crosslink">Serena Williams</a> won the 2017 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/Australian-Open" class="md-crosslink">Australian Open</a> when she was eight weeks <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/pregnancy" class="md-crosslink">pregnant</a>. She found out days before the tournament after experiencing a bout of nausea that prompted her to take a pregnancy test. Her doctor cleared her to play, and she went on to claim her 23rd singles Grand Slam victory without dropping a single set.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: A living repudiation of the Nazi’s Aryan “master race” theory, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesse-Owens" class="md-crosslink">Jesse Owens</a> won gold in the 100-metre dash, in the 200-metre dash, and as a member of the 4 x 100-metre relay team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He nearly did not qualify for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/long-jump" class="md-crosslink">long jump</a> event after fouling during his first two attempts. Before his third and final jump, German competitor Luz Long helped Owens regain his focus. Owens would qualify for the event, win the gold medal with a world record leap, and begin an unlikely friendship with Long.</dd>

                    <dd>Answer: Before 2016 the city of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cleveland-Ohio" class="md-crosslink">Cleveland</a>, Ohio, had not won a sports championship in 52 years. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/LeBron-James" class="md-crosslink">LeBron James</a> and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cleveland-Cavaliers" class="md-crosslink">Cavaliers</a> dropped their first two games against the Golden State Warriors.

                    <dt>Question: Leading up to Super Bowl III in 1969, New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath made headlines for doing what?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-York-Jets" class="md-crosslink">New York Jets</a> were an 18-point underdog going into Super Bowl III against the Baltimore Colts. While <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Namath" class="md-crosslink">Joe Namath</a> was receiving an award during a banquet days before the game, a heckler yelled that the Colts would win handily. Namath’s response garnered the ire of the Jets coach, who thought the statement would inspire the Colts. Namath went on to make good on his promise, leading the Jets to a 16–7 victory.</dd>

                    <dt>Question: Years later, claiming it was revenge for the Falklands War, Diego Maradona’s infamous “Hand of God” soccer play helped defeat—and enrage–what nation?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: During a 1986 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/World-Cup-football" class="md-crosslink">World Cup</a> quarterfinal match against England, Argentine player <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Diego-Maradona" class="md-crosslink">Diego Maradona</a> managed to knock the soccer ball into the net using his hand. Although it was a clear violation of rules, the referees did not disallow the goal, giving Argentina the lead. Argentina went on to win the game. In his memoirs, Maradona described the victory as a chance to avenge the military loss Argentina had experienced against the English during the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Falkland-Islands-War" class="md-crosslink">Falklands War</a>.</dd>
