He contemplated various explanations—for example, that these stars were actually very slowly moving planets—before he settled on the essentially correct theory that all the stars made a gradual eastward revolution relative to the equinoxes. Ever since Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) established his heliocentric model of the universe, the stars have provided a fixed frame of reference, relative to which the plane of the Equator slowly shifts, a phenomenon referred to as the <link id=\"190813\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/science/precession-of-the-equinoxes\">precession of the equinoxes</link>.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">red shift</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">plane of the ecliptic</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">diurnal rotation</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>In honour of their discoverer, Jupiter’s four largest moons—Io, Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto—are collectively given what title?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Galilean satellites</answer> <explanation>The first objects in the solar system discovered by means of a telescope were the four brightest satellites of Jupiter. <link id=\"224058\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Galileo-Galilei\">Galileo</link>, who first observed them in 1610, proposed that the satellites be named the Medicean stars in honour of his patron, Cosimo II de’ Medici, but they soon came to be known as the <link id=\"224023\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/science/Galilean-satellite\">Galilean satellites</link> in honour of their discoverer.

He built a linear, directional antenna by which he was able to identify all the sources of interference except one. After months of study he discovered in 1931 that the source of the unidentified radio interference came from the stars. By the following spring he concluded that the source lay in the direction of the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Although the object would tend to fall toward the Earth’s surface because of gravitational force, its momentum would cause it to descend along a curved path. Greater velocity would put it into a stable orbit, like that of the Moon, or direct it away from the Earth altogether. On the basis of this thought experiment, Newton has been credited with the idea of putting an artificial satellite into orbit.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Maria Gaetana Agnesi</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Galileo Galilei</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Maria Mitchell</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Whose Earth-centred model of the universe dominated astronomy through the Middle Ages?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Ptolemy</answer> <explanation><link id=\"482098\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Ptolemy\">Ptolemy</link> argued in the <i>Almagest</i> (completed about 150 BCE) that the Earth is a stationary sphere at the centre of a vastly larger celestial sphere that revolves at a perfectly uniform rate around the Earth, carrying with it the stars, planets, Sun, and Moon.

Halley published in 1705 <i>A Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets</i>, in which he showed that the three historic comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were so similar in characteristics that they must have been successive returns of the same object—now known as Halley's Comet—and accurately predicted its return in 1758.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">William Herschel</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Mary Watson Whitney</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Henrietta Swan Leavitt</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>What astronomical object, beginning as a supernova (violently exploding star) and observed by Chinese astronomers in 1054, can still be seen in the constellation Taurus?</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Crab Nebula</answer> <explanation>The <link id=\"141496\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/place/Crab-Nebula\">Crab Nebula</link>, probably the most intensely studied bright nebula, is about 6,500 light-years from Earth.

In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Often used to add a flavorful boost to sushi, <em>wasabi</em> has a flavor very similar to what?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: True <em>wasabi</em> is made from a different plant than horseradish; the similar flavors and wasabi’s relatively high price means some restaurants use horseradish as a substitute.</dd>

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Steak <em>tartare</em> is served in what way?</dt>

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: An <em>amuse-bouche</em> is traditionally served at what point during a fine dining experience?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: French for “(it) entertains (the) mouth,” an <em>amuse-bouche</em> is a small complimentary appetizer, which is served before a meal; studies show that appetizers tend to increase saliva production.</dd>

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: <em>Bok choy</em> is a Chinese variety of what vegetable?</dt>
