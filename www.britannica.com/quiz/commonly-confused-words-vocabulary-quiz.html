Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

	        <h1>Commonly Confused Words Vocabulary Quiz</h1>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: I went to the ______ store to buy a birthday card.</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: While technically most stores are <em>stationary</em> (that is, “immobile”), a place to buy writing materials, such as paper and pens, is a <em>stationery</em> store.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of these words mean “capable of being easily ignited and of burning quickly”?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The prefix <em>in-</em> often means “not” but can also mean “the cause of.” <em>Inflammable</em> was used first, but, because of the potential for confusion, <em>flammable</em> is now the preferred term for something easily caught on fire, and <em>nonflammable</em> is its opposite.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: How often are <em>biweekly</em> meetings held?</dt>

                    <dd>Answer: Although both words come from the Latin for “to complete,” only <em>complement</em> means “something that fills up, completes, or makes better or perfect.” <em>Compliment</em>, on the other hand, means “an admiring remark.”</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>

                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: I took a moment to ______ the contract.</dt>

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: I go running as part of my _____ workout.</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <em>Everyday</em>, with no space, usually functions as an adjective, and is synonymous with the word <em>ordinary</em>. <em>Every day</em> usually functions as an adverb phrase, as in, “I water my plants every day.” If you can substitute the word <em>each</em> for <em>every</em> and it still seems fine, then <em>every day</em> (with a space) is the right choice.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: The actress landed her biggest ______ yet.</dt>

                    <dt>Question: The ______ of the story is to be kind to others.</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <em>Moral</em> and <em>morale</em> differ by one letter, which makes them easy to confuse. In this case, a <em>moral</em> is a practical lesson, whereas <em>morale</em> can be related to enthusiasm. Mentally linking the <em>e</em> in <em>morale</em> to enthusiasm is a way to help remember which word is preferred.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: If everybody’s ready, let's ______ with the presentation.</dt>
