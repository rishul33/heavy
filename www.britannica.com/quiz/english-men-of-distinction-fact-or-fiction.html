After his army killed Tsar Konstantin during one of the battles, Ivaylo was recognized as the new tsar of Bulgaria. <i>[This explanation and all others in this quiz have been adapted from <link id=\"3754\" type=\"feature\" url=\"/list/7-monarchs-with-unfortunate-nicknames\">7 Monarchs with Unfortunate Nicknames</link>.]</i></explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Fruela II</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Fyodor II</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Boniface IV</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>the Do-Nothing</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Louis V of France</answer> <explanation>The last king of the Carolingian dynasty, <link id=\"348818\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Louis-V\">Louis V</link> was known for his disappointing and uneventful reign. Crowned King of Aquitaine in 979 while his father was still alive, Louis the Do-Nothing proceeded to do just that.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Egbert of Wessex</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">Elizabeth I of England</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">William I of Prussia</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>the Bald</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Holy Roman Emperor Charles II</answer> <explanation>Whether or not the Holy Roman emperor <link id=\"106851\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Charles-II-Holy-Roman-emperor\">Charles II</link> was actually bald remains a hotly contested point. Some historians theorize that the nickname may have been more ironic than illustrative. But some scholars have another explanation. In the 9th century, baldness provoked laughter, and those who suffered from such ridicule retorted by citing the “great bald men of the past.” If Charles was bald, it is thought he would have welcomed the association with these great historical figures.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Charles II of Great Britain</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">Charles II of Spain</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Charles II of Naples</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>Bloody</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Mary</answer> <explanation>Daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, <link id=\"367515\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Mary-I\">Mary I</link> became the first sole female monarch of England. From the beginning of her reign, in 1553, she was determined to make Catholicism England’s primary religion through her marriage to Phillip II of Spain. A Protestant rebellion led by Sir Thomas Wyatt soon erupted but was quickly suppressed by her supporters, who left a bloody residue of massacred “heretics.”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Catherine of Aragon</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">Harold II</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Alfonso IX</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>the Terrible</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Ivan IV</answer> <explanation>Most of the centralization reforms undertaken by Russian tsar <link id=\"298154\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Ivan-the-Terrible\">Ivan IV</link> were colored by his fervent desire to limit the powers of the hereditary aristocracy in favor of the service gentry. The “reign of terror” that would make him known as Ivan the Terrible was designed to make individuals’ land and status dependent ultimately on the sovereign. The tsar’s wrath was not limited to non-royals; in 1581, he murdered his son Ivan, the only viable heir to his throne, initiating a period known as the Time of Troubles.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Clement II</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">Isabella I</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Aethelberht</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>the Bad</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">William I of Sicily</answer> <explanation>Contrary to his less-than-positive epithet, <link id=\"644071\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/William-I-king-of-Sicily\">William I</link> ruled Sicily in an efficient and progressive manner. He promoted science and letters during his reign, and he practiced religious tolerance. William’s infamy initially came from his suppression of the power of Sicily’s barons in favor of a more centralized authority. But even with his newfound royal authority, he lost Sicily’s African territories by 1160 and rebellions erupted throughout his kingdom.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Valentinian III</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">George IV of Great Britain</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Frederick William II of Prussia</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>the Mad</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Charles VI of France</answer> <explanation><link id=\"107095\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Charles-VI-king-of-France\">Charles VI</link> of France ascended to the throne in 1380, at the age of 11, and became the sole ruler of the country eight years later. During disputes between England over the residence of the papacy in 1392, Charles had an attack of “madness” that included fever and convulsions.

Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?
