Kennedy</link> showed a confident optimism with comments such as “We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we’re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.” He went on to defeat <link id=\"416465\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Richard-Nixon\">Richard Nixon</link>. </explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Richard Nixon</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“When I hear your new ideas, I’m reminded of that ad: ‘Where’s the beef?’ ”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Walter Mondale</answer> <explanation><link id=\"389066\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Walter-Mondale\">Walter Mondale</link> was challenged for the <link id=\"1575886\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1984\">1984</link> Democratic nomination by <link id=\"1296017\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Gary-Hart\">Gary Hart</link>, who promoted himself as “the candidate with new ideas.” Mondale’s response, in a debate with other Democratic candidates during the primary season, quoted a popular TV commercial of the time: “When I hear your new ideas, I’m reminded of that ad: ‘Where’s the beef?’ ”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Gary Hart</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">Jesse Jackson</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">John Glenn</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query> “I served with Jack Kennedy.

When Quayle remarked that he had as much political experience as John F. Kennedy did when he ran for president, Bentsen pounced: “I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy.

She responded with a concise summary of her work as secretary of state: “As soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Donald Trump</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“There you go again.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Ronald Reagan</answer> <explanation>The only debate between <link id=\"97239\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Jimmy-Carter\">Jimmy Carter</link> and <link id=\"492882\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Ronald-Reagan\">Ronald Reagan</link> during the <link id=\"1576043\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1980\">1980</link> presidential campaign generated Reagan’s amiable “There you go again” in reaction to Carter’s remarks on health care.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Jimmy Carter</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men.…I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks?’ and they brought us whole binders full of women.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Mitt Romney</answer> <explanation>In a <link id=\"1815756\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/United-States-Presidential-Election-of-2012\">2012</link> debate with President <link id=\"973560\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Barack-Obama\">Barack Obama</link>, Republican nominee <link id=\"1350619\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Mitt-Romney\">Mitt Romney</link> was asked to address the issue of pay equity for women. The anecdote he shared, intended to demonstrate his commitment to equal treatment, instead made him look out of touch: “I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men.…I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks?’ and they brought us whole binders full of women.” The phrase “binders full of women” took on a life of its own.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Barack Obama</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Donald Trump</answer> <explanation>In the <link type=\"website\" url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/politics/third-debate-transcript.html\">final debate</link> between <link id=\"121809\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Hillary-Clinton\">Hillary Clinton</link> and <link id=\"607230\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Donald-Trump\">Donald Trump</link> during the <link id=\"2023804\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/topic/United-States-presidential-election-of-2016\">2016</link> campaign, Clinton noted that “Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.” Trump <link type=\"website\" url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B7KPRo30y4\">responded</link>, “Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.” When the audience laughed, the moderator requested silence.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Hillary Clinton</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“You’re likable enough, Hillary.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Barack Obama</answer> <explanation>In a <link id=\"1335480\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-2008\">2008</link> debate among Democratic candidates for president, discussion veered into what one questioner called “the likability issue”—specifically, that <link id=\"121809\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Hillary-Clinton\">Hillary Clinton</link> seemed to be losing to <link id=\"973560\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Barack-Obama\">Barack Obama</link> on that front. Clinton handled the question with humor: “He’s very likable. I agree with that. I don’t think I’m that bad.” Obama’s response—“You're likable enough, Hillary”—came across as cold and, <link type=\"website\" url=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4092530\">as George Stephanopoulos put it</link>, “a little peevish.”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Hillary Clinton</answer>    <answer correct=\"false\">John Edwards</answer>   <answer correct=\"false\">Bill Richardson</answer>   </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"2\"> <question> <query>“I’d like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Al Gore</answer> <explanation>In the <link id=\"1573012\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1996\">1996</link> vice presidential debate, <link id=\"239178\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Al-Gore\">Al Gore</link> faced Republican nominee <link id=\"314641\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Jack-Kemp\">Jack Kemp</link>, a former congressman who had gone into politics after playing quarterback in college and on professional football teams. Gore poked fun at his own reputation as a wonkish environmental-policy advocate: “I’d like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.” Kemp’s response: “It’s a deal. I can’t even pronounce it.”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Jack Kemp</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“Well, actually, he forgot Poland.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">George W. Bush</answer> <explanation>The <link id=\"870845\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/Iraq-War\">Iraq War</link>, which had started in 2003, dominated the <link id=\"1570196\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-2004\">2004</link> presidential campaign. In his first debate with President <link id=\"86112\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/George-W-Bush\">George W. Bush</link>, Democratic nominee <link id=\"938795\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/John-Kerry\">John Kerry</link> claimed there was insufficient international support for the war. “When we went in,” he said, “there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia, and the United States.” Bush responded by fact-checking Kerry: “Well, actually, he forgot Poland.”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">John Kerry</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“It’s hard to get any word in with this clown—excuse me, this person.”</query> </question>  <answer correct=\"true\">Joe Biden</answer> <explanation>The first debate between President <link id=\"607230\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Donald-Trump\">Donald Trump</link> and Democratic nominee <link id=\"1336937\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Joe-Biden\">Joe Biden</link> during the 2020 campaign was, to say the least, <link type=\"website\" url=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?475793-1/trump-biden-debate\">a fractious one</link>, full of crosstalk and personal insults. About halfway through the debate, as Trump talked over him, Biden closed his eyes, paused for a moment, and then coolly observed, “It’s hard to get any word in with this clown—excuse me, this person.”</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Donald Trump</answer>  </qMultipleChoice>  <qMultipleChoice level=\"4\"> <question> <query>“I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

During a debate with <link id=\"389066\" type=\"topic\" url=\"/biography/Walter-Mondale\">Walter Mondale</link>, the Democratic nominee, he stepped around the issue with a joke: “I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” Even Mondale—the 56-year-old former senator and vice president—laughed.</explanation>   <answer correct=\"false\">Walter Mondale</answer>  </qMultipleChoice> </questionList>  </quiz> </feature>","urlTitle":"12-quotes-from-us-presidential-debates-a-quiz","typeDisplayName":"Quiz","cssClassName":"QUIZ","mainCategory":{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens.

In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being. Research on potential treatments and preventive medicine has expanded greatly with the development of modern medicine, and a network of disciplines, including such fields as genetics, psychology, and nutrition, aims to facilitate the betterment of our health.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg","altText":"Health & Medicine","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/07/192107-050-CE043374/anatomy-charts-human-body-muscle-systems-skeletal.jpg"}},{"id":8000,"title":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","urlTitle":"Lifestyles-Social-Issues","description":"It's easy enough to agree that human beings all around the world have certain basic requirements that must be fulfilled in order to ensure their individual and collective well-being. History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word. A literary work can transport us into a fictional, fantastic new world, describe a fleeting feeling, or simply give us a picture of the past through novels, poems, tragedies, epic works, and other genres. Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too. Thanks to human curiosity and technological research, many significant inventions have been made throughout history that in turn made a difference in our daily lives.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg","altText":"Technology","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/84/203584-131-357FBE7D/speed-internet-technology-background.jpg"}},{"id":11000,"title":"Visual Arts","urlTitle":"Visual-Arts","description":"These are the arts that meet the eye and evoke an emotion through an expression of skill and imagination. They include the most ancient forms, such as painting and drawing, and the arts that were born thanks to the development of technology, like sculpture, printmaking, photography, and installation art. Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, different eras in art history have had their own principles to define beauty, from the richly ornamented taste of the Baroque to the simple utilitarian style of the Prairie School.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg","altText":"Visual Arts","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg"}},{"id":6000,"title":"World History","urlTitle":"World-History","description":"Does history really repeat itself, or can we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us?

After the National Party's return to power in 1990, she became deputy leader of the opposition in Parliament. In 1993 she was elected head of the Labour Party, becoming the first woman in New Zealand to head a major party. In 1999, when the Labour Party was able to form a governing coalition, Clark was elected prime minister, becoming the first woman in the country to hold the office of prime minister immediately following an election. </dd>

                    <dt>Question: Which American first lady’s defense of the rights of African Americans, youth, and the poor during the 1930s and ’40s helped bring those groups into the American political process?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eleanor-Roosevelt" class="md-crosslink">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> was first lady (1933–45); the wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 32nd president of the United States; and a United Nations diplomat and humanitarian. During her 12 years as first lady, the breadth of Eleanor's activities and her advocacy of liberal causes made her nearly as controversial a figure as her husband. Her defense of the rights of African Americans, youth, and the poor helped bring groups into government that formerly had been alienated from the political process in the United States.</dd>

After her husband, who became prime minister of Ceylon in 1956, was assassinated in 1959, she was induced by his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to become the party's leader. The SLFP won a decisive victory at the general election in July 1960, and she became prime minister. She left office in 1965 but returned to serve two more terms (1970–77 and 1994–2000) as prime minister.</dd>
