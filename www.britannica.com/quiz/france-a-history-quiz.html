Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},null,null],"hashtags":["traditions","religion","traditions quiz","quiz","britannica","encyclopedia britannica","quizzes"],"hashtagsString":"traditions, religion, traditions quiz, quiz, britannica, encyclopedia britannica, quizzes","displayDate":[2012,8,10],"contentXml":"<feature id=\"4479\">\n  \n  <quiz level=\"1\" NumOfQuestions=\"7\" isGeneral=\"false\" isVocabulary=\"false\" isTightrope=\"false\" isPopular=\"false\"><timing timed=\"true\" seconds=\"10\"/>\n    \n    \n    <metaDescription>Take this religion quiz on encyclopedia britannica to test your knowledge on traditions and religions around the world.</metaDescription><browserTitle>World Religions and Traditions Quiz</browserTitle><questionList>\n        <qMultipleChoice level=\"3\">\n          <question>\n            <query>What holiday ends Ramadan?</query>\n          </question>\n          \n            <answer correct=\"true\">Eid al-Fitr</answer>\n            <explanation>Eid al-Fitr, the Feast of Fast-Breaking, marks the end of the month of Ramadan and the beginning of the month of Shawwal.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}}},{"id":5056,"title":"Vegetable Variety: Fact or Fiction?","url":"/quiz/vegetable-variety-fact-or-fiction","description":"Are broccoli and cauliflower types of cabbage?

Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of these French women was charged with the crime of wearing men’s clothing?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Joan-of-Arc" class="md-crosslink">Joan of Arc</a> was a peasant girl who became a great military leader for France, defeating the English at Orléans in 1429. Unfortunately, she ran afoul of religious authorities by claiming God spoke directly to her (undermining the church) and wearing men’s clothing. She was convicted of heresy and burned at the stake. Decades later the conviction was overturned. In the 20th century she was made a saint.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of the following places is famous as Napoleon I’s place of exile?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The island of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Elba-island-Italy" class="md-crosslink">Elba</a> is located off the west coast of Italy, in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is famous as Napoleon I’s place of exile in 1814–15. Napoleon’s chief residence, the Mulini Palace, overlooks the sea near Portoferraio, Elba’s chief town, on the north coast. His summer residence, Villa San Martino, lies 4 miles (6 km) southwest.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: By 50 BCE, which famous historical figure had conquered the area today known as France?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: From 58 to 50 BCE, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Caesar-Roman-ruler" class="md-crosslink">Julius Caesar</a> campaigned in Gaul (the area now known as France) ostensibly to make Rome safe from barbarian invasions, with the added bonus of improving his personal wealth. Roman influence can still be seen in France today; for example, the French language comes from Latin, the language of Rome.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which holiday commemorates the beginning of the French Revolution?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bastille-Day" class="md-crosslink">Bastille Day</a>, celebrated in France and its overseas <em>départements</em> and territories, is a holiday marking the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille in Paris and thus the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: What method of execution became popular during the French Revolution?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, a physician and member of France’s National Assembly, called for a humane and painless way to execute people. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/guillotine" class="md-crosslink">guillotine</a> was put to use against the aristocracy in 1792; France’s last guillotine execution happened in 1977.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which battle was Napoleon I’s final defeat?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Waterloo" class="md-crosslink">Battle of Waterloo</a> (June 18, 1815) was Napoleon I's final defeat, ending 23 years of recurrent warfare between France and the other powers of Europe. It was fought between Napoleon's 72,000 troops and the combined forces of the duke of Wellington's allied army of 68,000 (with British, Dutch, Belgian, and German units) and about 45,000 Prussians, the main force of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's command. Four days later Napoleon abdicated for the second time.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which queen’s actions contributed to the unrest that led to the French Revolution?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Antoinette-queen-of-France" class="md-crosslink">Marie-Antoinette</a>, queen consort of King Louis XVI of France, was an enemy of reform whose actions contributed to the popular unrest that led to the French Revolution and to the overthrow of the monarchy in August 1792.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: What French innovator wrote of their work, “The glowing tubes looked like faint, fairy lights”?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: Thanks to her work with radiation, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Curie" class="md-crosslink">Marie Curie</a> was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. She and her husband discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, the latter’s radioactive gleamings she described poetically as “fairy lights.”</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of these French landmarks was designed to be taken down after 20 years?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eiffel-Tower-Paris-France" class="md-crosslink">Eiffel Tower</a> was constructed for the International Exposition of 1889. Paris gave Gustave Eiffel use of the land the tower stood on for 20 years. Fortunately, the structure was able to prove its usefulness as an antenna in the blossoming field of radio, and in 1910 the lease was renewed for 70 years.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Which of these was a result of France losing the Battle of Trafalgar?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Trafalgar-European-history" class="md-crosslink">Battle of Trafalgar</a> (October 21, 1805), a naval engagement during the Napoleonic Wars, established British naval supremacy for more than 100 years and shattered forever Napoleon I's plans to invade England.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Napoleon had which of the following nicknames?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: The nickname “The Little Corporal” is thought to have been a term of affection used by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Napoleon-I" class="md-crosslink">Napoleon</a>’s soldiers, not a reflection of his stature. Contemporary portraits don’t suggest he was particularly short, and the height on his autopsy report is roughly the same as for other Frenchmen of the time.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: France is credited with developing what military innovation during World War I?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: France employed painters such as Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola to develop techniques to hide soldiers and artillery from aerial reconnaissance (also a new military tool in World War I). <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/camouflage-military-tactic" class="md-crosslink">Camouflage</a> comes from the French <em>camoufler</em> meaning “to disguise.”</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Founded by Greek mariners in 600 BCE, what is the oldest city in France?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Marseille" class="md-crosslink">Marseille</a> sits on the southern coast of France, an important location for ancient sailors on the Mediterranean Sea.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: Dating back to the French Revolution, what is the national motto of France?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: In 1790 the high-ranking revolutionary <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maximilien-Robespierre" class="md-crosslink">Maximilien Robespierre</a> advocated for the phrase to be written on every flag and soldier’s uniform. Although this didn’t come to pass, the phrase did end up becoming the French national motto.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: What French author’s father was a general for Napoleon and was nicknamed “the Black Devil”?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexandre-Dumas-pere" class="md-crosslink">Alexandre Dumas</a> is well known for classics like <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, but his father <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexandre-Dumas-French-general" class="md-crosslink">Thomas-Alexandre Dumas</a> was famous in his own right. The child of an enslaved Haitian and a white Frenchman, the elder Dumas joined the French army, rose through the ranks, and became France’s first Black general.&nbsp;The author Dumas is said to have based some of the action in his novels on his father’s exploits.</dd>
                </dl>
            <dl>
                    <dt>Question: What former colony’s 1962 independence caused about a million European descendants to flee to France?</dt>
                    <dd>Answer: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria" class="md-crosslink">Algeria</a> had been under French rule for about 130 years, during which time Europeans from various countries moved in and became French citizens, as did their descendants. When Algeria became independent, many of them fled to France, fearing retribution.</dd>
