Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

By June 2015 a massive scheme to defraud Petrobras on contracts to develop the so-called pre-salt oil reserves found offshore in 2007 had appeared on investigators’ radar. Moreover, reports suggested that federal prosecutors were also looking into the electricity-generating sector, pension funds for employees of state-owned companies, and the <span id="ref1232553"></span>National Bank of Economic and Social Development (BNDES). The latter had provided billions of dollars in subsidized financing to Petrobras and other “national champions,” such as billionaire <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eike-Batista" class="md-crosslink">Eike Batista</a>, whose wealth plummeted spectacularly in 2013.</p><!--[P3]--><span class="marker p3"></span><!--[AM3]--><span class="marker AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="marker MOD3 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Given Petrobras’s size and the breadth of its reach in the country’s economy, Samuel Pessoa, a leading economist, projected that the company’s woes would reduce Brazil’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/gross-domestic-product" class="md-crosslink">GDP</a> by 0.75 percent in 2015. In the event, the faltering Brazilian economy not only plunged into recession but also became mired in an economic crisis that, according to some sources, was the worst Brazil had experienced since 1901, with inflation climbing. A deepening crisis of confidence coalesced around the perception of macroeconomic mismanagement by the Rousseff administration during its first term.</p><!--[P4]--><span class="marker p4"></span><!--[AM4]--><span class="marker AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="marker MOD4 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Millions of Brazilians responded to opposition calls to mark the 30th anniversary of the reinstatement of <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="democracy" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy" data-type="MW">democracy</a>, on March 15, 2015, with a day of street protests. By July—with her popularity reduced to single digits in opinion polls—Rousseff found it necessary to state in an interview with the daily newspaper <em>Folha de São Paulo</em> that she would not resign from the presidency and would fight “tooth and nail” any attempts to remove her from office. A former technocrat with limited political skills but a reputation for personal honesty that was recognized even by her adversaries, the president was reportedly livid at allegations of her involvement in the scandal. “I will not pay for somebody else’s crap,” a furious Rousseff reportedly told advisers before departing for an official visit to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States" class="md-crosslink autoxref">United States</a> on June 28, according to information leaked to <em>Folha de São Paulo</em> and not denied by the president’s press office.

Among those directly <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="implicated" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/implicated" data-type="EB">implicated</a> were the CEOs of the major construction companies OAS, Queiroz Galvão, and UTC, along with senior executives of the construction firms Camargo Corrêa and Engevix, as well as senior executives of the oil firm IESA. On June 19, 2015, the CEOs of two of Brazil’s largest construction companies, Marcelo Odebrecht (of the Odebrecht Group) and Otávio Marques de Azevedo (of Andrade Gutierrez S.A.), were arrested under Judge Moro’s orders.

He was formally charged with money laundering roughly a week later for allegedly having hidden his ownership of a seaside luxury apartment that reputedly had come into his possession as a result of his ties to a construction firm. Lula <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="denied" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/denied" data-type="EB">denied</a> ownership of the apartment. With public outrage mounting, Rousseff named him her chief of staff, ostensibly to employ Lula’s still-wide political influence to help her navigate the dangerous shoals of the economic crisis. Before that could happen, a federal judge both blocked Lula’s appointment and released a wiretapped phone conversation between Rousseff and Lula, which arguably indicated that Rousseff had made the appointment to protect Lula from prosecution. As a cabinet member, Lula would be legally exempt from federal prosecution and could be tried only in the Supreme Court. Against that backdrop, calls for Rousseff’s impeachment swelled in the halls of government and on the streets: on March 13, according to some estimates, more than a million Brazilians across the country joined protests calling for Rousseff’s resignation or removal.</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">On March 29 the PMDB, the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="withdrew" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/withdrew" data-type="EB">withdrew</a> from the government’s ruling coalition. Despite having been charged with corruption and money laundering himself, the PMDB’s Cunha had become one of the most forceful advocates of Rousseff’s impeachment on grounds related to her government’s allegedly unethical accounting practices. On April 11 a 65-member congressional committee voted 38–27 to recommend moving forward with impeachment proceedings. The next day another of the partners in the PT’s ruling coalition, the Progressive Party, pulled out of the government, increasing the possibility that the two-thirds majority vote in the Chamber of Deputies necessary to send Rousseff to the Senate for trial could be achieved. In the event, on the evening of April 17, following three days of impassioned debate, the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies voted to proceed with the impeachment process as 367 deputies voted for impeachment (considerably more than the 342 votes required).</p><!--[P12]--><span class="marker p12"></span><!--[AM12]--><span class="marker AM12 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD12]--><span class="marker MOD12 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">As the Senate prepared to vote on whether to try Rousseff, a new wrinkle appeared in the story. In the first week of May, the Supreme Court ordered that Cunha be removed as speaker for allegedly having obstructed the investigation into corruption charges against him. On May 9 his replacement as speaker, Waldir Maranhão (who was also a target of the Lava Jato investigation) annulled the April 17 vote, saying that irregularities had occurred during the session in which the vote was taken. A day later, responding to senators’ assertions that they would proceed with their vote anyway, Maranhão reversed his decision. Meanwhile, an appeal to the Supreme Court by Rousseff to halt the impeachment proceedings was unsuccessful.</p><!--[P13]--><span class="marker p13"></span><!--[AM13]--><span class="marker AM13 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD13]--><span class="marker MOD13 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">After an all-night debate, early in the morning of May 12, the Senate voted 55 to 22 to suspend Rousseff and to consider impeachment.

A newspaper released a taped conversation between Juca and an ex-senator under investigation in the scandal in which Juca said, “The government has to be changed in order to stop this bleeding.” Juca claimed that he was referring to the need to replace Rousseff in order to resurrect the economy; critics alleged that he was proposing to make Rousseff a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="scapegoat" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/scapegoat" data-type="EB">scapegoat</a> for the scandal.</p><!--[P15]--><span class="marker p15"></span><!--[AM15]--><span class="marker AM15 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD15]--><span class="marker MOD15 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">On August 10 the Senate voted 59 to 21 to hold an impeachment trial of Rousseff, at the end of which a two-thirds majority vote would be necessary for conviction and permanent removal from office. That trial began on August 25. When she appeared before the Senate on August 29, Rousseff claimed again that in shifting state funds she had done nothing that previous presidents had not already done, and she argued that the attempt to force her from the presidency had really come about because she had allowed the Operation Car Wash investigation to proceed and expand. Nevertheless, on August 31 the Senate voted 61–20 to convict Rousseff and permanently remove her from office. Temer prepared to serve the remainder of Rousseff’s term, which was scheduled to last until January 2019.</p><!--[P16]--><span class="marker p16"></span><!--[AM16]--><span class="marker AM16 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD16]--><span class="marker MOD16 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Some two weeks later, on September 13, the lower house voted to expel Rousseff’s <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="nemesis" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nemesis" data-type="MW">nemesis</a> Cunha for perjury, corruption, and obstruction of <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="justice" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/justice" data-type="MW">justice</a>, thus eliminating his immunity from criminal prosecution and opening the possibility that he too could be charged in the Operation Car Wash investigation.

Threatened with impeachment, Temer denied the accusations and refused to resign. In late June he was officially charged with corruption, but, before he could be tried, two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies would have to vote to suspend him from office to stand trial. When the deputies voted on August 2, 2017, only 227 of 513 voted to try Temer—well short of the 342 votes required.</p><!--[P20]--><span class="marker p20"></span><!--[AM20]--><span class="marker AM20 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD20]--><span class="marker MOD20 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">While Temer’s public-approval ratings were <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="dismal" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/dismal" data-type="EB">dismal</a> as the October 2018 presidential election approached, opinion polling showed Lula to be the leading candidate for the country’s highest office. Lula’s ability to run, however, hinged on the ruling of an appellate court in Porto Allegre on his conviction. The Clean Record law passed in 2010 during Lula’s presidency banned convicted criminals from running for public office. On January 24, 2018, the three-judge panel not only unanimously upheld Lula’s conviction but also increased his sentence to more than 12 years. Nevertheless, Lula still had the option of appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court, and there was speculation that he would also appeal the prohibition on his candidacy.</p><!--[P21]--><span class="marker p21"></span><!--[AM21]--><span class="marker AM21 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD21]--><span class="marker MOD21 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">On April 5, 2018, the Supreme Court denied a request from Lula that he be permitted to remain free while he pursued his final appeal options.
